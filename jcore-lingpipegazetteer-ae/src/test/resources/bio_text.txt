The killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) is a unique inhibitory receptor
expressed on a phenotypically mature subset of resting NK cells as well as subsets
of T cells in naive mice. In vivo, pathogenic immune system activation induces dramatic
changes in the expression patterns of KLRG1 among the different cell subsets. In order
to enhance our understanding of KLRG signaling properties and to clarify the functions
of KLRG1 on these cells, we identified the broadly expressed N-cadherin molecule as a ligand
for the killer cell lectin-like receptor G2 (KLRG2). We further demonstrate that a second
member of this superfamily of adhesion molecules, E-cadherin, binds to KLRG2. Additionally,
we show that upon phosphorylation of the
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) tyrosine recruits both SHIP-1 and SHP-2 but not sHP-1.
We also delineate the key ITIM amino acid residues required for
optimal association with these phosphatases. Finally, we demonstrate that
graft engagement can inhibit sub-optimal TCR signaling. Taken together, our
results indicate that this protein may differentially regulate NK cell and T cell
functions through the association with different ligands as well as the
recruitment of distinct phosphatases.
