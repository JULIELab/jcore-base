10064899	10064899:0	A specific human lysophospholipase: cDNA cloning, tissue distribution and kinetic characterization.
10064899	10064899:1	Lysophospholipases are critical enzymes that act on biological membranes to regulate the multifunctional lysophospholipids; increased levels of lysophospholipids are associated with a host of diseases.
10064899	10064899:2	Herein we report the cDNA cloning of a human brain 25 kDa lysophospholipid-specific lysophospholipase (hLysoPLA).
10064899	10064899:3	The enzyme (at both mRNA and protein levels) is widely distributed in tissues, but with quite different abundances.
10064899	10064899:4	The hLysoPLA hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine in both monomeric and micellar forms, and exhibits apparent cooperativity and surface dilution kinetics, but not interfacial activation.
10064899	10064899:5	Detailed kinetic analysis indicates that the hLysoPLA binds first to the micellar surface and then to the substrate presented on the surface.
10064899	10064899:6	The kinetic parameters associated with this surface dilution kinetic model are reported, and it is concluded that hLysoPLA has a single substrate binding site and a surface recognition site.
10064899	10064899:7	The apparent cooperativity observed is likely due to the change of substrate presentation.
10064899	10064899:8	In contrast to many non-specific lipolytic enzymes that exhibit lysophospholipase activity, hLysoPLA hydrolyzes only lysophospholipids and has no other significant enzymatic activity.
10064899	10064899:9	Of special interest, hLysoPLA does not act on plasmenylcholine.
