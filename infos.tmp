**FraMed**: 10-fold-crossvalidation

| *JSBD* | **F-Score** | **Accuracy** |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| official Mallet | 0.993 | 0.985 |
| modified Mallet [1] | 0.994 | 0.987 |

| *JTBD* | **F-Score** | **Accuracy** |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| official Mallet | 0.995 | 0.992 |
| modified Mallet [1] | 0.996 | 0.992 |

[1] these are the figures from the 2014 LREC paper; I haven't been able to reproduce them (and that was the reason why I tried the official Mallet artifact) because I couldn't train a model with at least one of JSBD & JTDB (can't recall which) but also couldn't do a crossvalidation with both.
Training was necessary as I wanted to provide FraMed models with the new JCoRe update.
