China to build nuclear-powered desalinator project

JINAN, June 24 (Xinhua)

China late this year will start building a nuclear-powered
desalinator project in Yantai City in east China's Shandong Province,
with a designed capacity of producing 52 million tons of fresh water
a year.

Officials with the Development Planning Commission of the Shandong
provincial government said the project, to be built in cooperation
with Qinghua University, would alleviate water shortages in the city
and other parts of the Shandong Peninsula.

Yantai and other parts of Shandong suffered acute water shortages due
to droughts in recent years, changing climate and other reasons.

Approved by the State Development and Reform Commission, the project
is expected to cost 1.6 billion yuan (nearly 200 million US dollars).

Zhang Zuoyi, director of the Nuclear Energy Technology and Design
Institute attached to Qinghua University, was quoted in Monday's
Beijing Evening News as saying the fresh water to be produced from
the project will cost 3.75 yuan per ton, much less than the cost of
water from existing sources.

The project is expected to use a 200-megawatt nuclear-powered reactor
designed by the institute, according to the paper.

The project would be completed and operational in 2007, it said.
