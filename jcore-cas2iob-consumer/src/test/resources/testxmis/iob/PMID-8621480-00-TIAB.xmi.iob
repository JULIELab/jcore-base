Ca2+-modulating			B_Gene
cyclophilin			I_Gene
ligand			I_Gene
(			O
CAML			O
)			O
was			O
originally			O
described			O
as			O
a			O
cyclophilin			B_Gene
B-binding			I_Gene
protein			I_Gene
whose			O
overexpression			O
in			O
T			O
cells			O
causes			O
a			O
rise			O
in			O
intracellular			O
calcium			O
,			O
thus			O
activating			O

structure-function			O

of			O
the			O
CAML			B_Gene

Jurkat			O

indicates			O

are			O
necessary			O

We			O
propose			O
that			O
the			O
hydrophobic			O
C-terminal			O
tail			O
of			O
CAML			O
forms			O
its			O
effector			O
