Establishment of multipotential and antigen presenting cell lines derived from myeloid leukemias in GM-CSF transgenic mice. 
In this study neonatal mice expressing a GM-CSF transgene (GMT mice), and their normal littermate controls, were infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) to examine in vivo tumorigenesis. 
By 200 days, all of the GMT mice had died whereas median survival had not been reached in the littermates (P < 0.0003). 
Thymomas developed in 32% of GMT mice and were more frequently CD4+CD8+ (83%) compared to the CD4+CD8- phenotype seen in 90% of thymomas developing in MoMLV-infected littermate mice. 
A primitive myeloid leukemia was induced in 21% of GMT mice, but none of the littermates. 
To characterize further the nature of the leukemic cells, a factor-dependent cell line (DGM36) was derived. 
DGM36 cells were tumorigenic, capable of differentiation to neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils, and contained a partial deletion of chromosome 2. 
A subline arose spontaneously that was factor-independent and produced GM-CSF in an autocrine manner (IGM36 cells). 
Stimulation of the IGM36 cells with TNF alpha and IFNgamma resulted in increased expression of B7-1, class I MHC and class II MHC and consequent presentation of antigen in allogeneic MLRs. 
IGM36 cells thereby satisfy many of the criteria of dendritic cells and consequently may be used to examine antigen presentation by leukemic cells. 
This is the first report of primary myeloid leukemias arising in GMT mice and documents the derivation of a multipotential, autocrine leukemic cell line with dendritic cell characteristics. 
Dexamethasone therapy worsens the neuropathology of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 encephalitis in SCID mice. 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) dementia is a late complication of viral infection. 
Cognitive dysfunction revolves around the secretion of neurotoxins from immunologically competent virus-infected brain macrophages and microglia. 
Such macrophage neurotoxins are inflammatory factors that produce selective neuronal dysfunction and ultimately cell death. 
To evaluate the potential efficacy of antiinflammatory therapy for HIV dementia, dexamethasone was administered to severe combined immunodeficient mice with HIV-1 encephalitis. 
Mice were given therapeutic doses of dexamethasone before intracerebral inoculation with HIV-1-infected human monocytes. 
Histochemical evaluation showed a worsening of neuropathology after treatment, with astrogliosis and increased apoptosis of neurons. 
Laboratory investigation of the mechanisms for the dexamethasone effects revealed increased viability of HIV-infected macrophages and incomplete suppression of neurotoxic inflammatory secretions. 
The results suggest the need for caution in administering glucocorticoids for treatment of HIV encephalitis in humans.
