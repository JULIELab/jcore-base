These results indicate that the component(s) of NF-AT has the potential to reconstitute NF(P) whereas NF-kappa B alone can not account for NF(P) in crude extracts.
Unlike NF-AT, NF(P) does not contain AP1 as its DNA binding component.
Activation of early growth response 1 gene transcription and pp90rsk during induction of monocytic differentiation.
The present work has studied mechanisms responsible for induction of early growth response 1 (EGR-1) gene expression during monocytic differentiation of U-937 myeloid leukemia cells.
Differentiation of U-937 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of the serine/threonine protein kinase C, was associated with transcriptional activation of EGR-1 promoter-reporter constructs.
