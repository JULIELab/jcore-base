Characterization of NF(P), the nuclear factor that interacts with the regulatory P sequence (5'-CGAAAATTTCC-3') of the human interleukin-4 gene: relationship to NF-kappa B and NF-AT.
The P sequence of the human interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene, which was defined as a responsive element for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and calcium ionophore (A23187) in Jurkat T cells, shares sequence similarity with the NF-kappa B and the NF-AT binding sites.
