The EGR-1 promoter contains six CC(A/T)6GG (CArG) motifs. The two 5'-most distal CArG sequences conferred TPA inducibility. In contrast, there was little effect of TPA on EGR-1 transcription in a TPA-resistant U-937 cell variant, designated TUR. Treatment of both U-937 and TUR cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, was associated with induction of monocytic differentiation and EGR-1 transcription through the 5'-most CArG element. Since these findings supported the involvement of serine/threonine protein phosphorylation in the regulation of EGR-1 expression, we studied activation of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 serine/threonine kinases, pp70S6K and pp90rsk. Although both kinases participate in regulating cell growth, there was no detectable activation of pp70S6K during TPA- or okadaic acid-induced monocytic differentiation.
