Moreover, rapamycin, an inhibitor of pp70S6K activation, had no effect on induction of EGR-1 expression. In contrast, analysis of pp90rsk activity by phosphorylation of a peptide derived from S6 protein demonstrated stimulation of this kinase in TPA-treated U-937, and not TUR, cells. Okadaic acid treatment of both cell types was associated with activation of pp90rsk. Antioxidants inhibit monocyte adhesion by suppressing nuclear factor-kappa B mobilization and induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in endothelial cells stimulated to generate radicals. Cell adhesion to endothelial cells stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is due to induction of surface receptors, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1).
