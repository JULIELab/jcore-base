17317680|t|Delayed expression of apoptotic and cell-cycle control genes in carcinogen-exposed bladders of mice lacking p53.S389 phosphorylation.
17317680|a|Mice with non-phosphorylated serine 389 in p53 are susceptible for bladder tumors induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF). Since p53 is a transcription factor, this might well be preceded by differences in the regulation of gene expression. Microarray analysis was used to determine early transcriptional changes that might underlie this cancer-prone phenotype. Interestingly, lack of Ser389 phosphorylation led to endogenously different gene expression levels. The number of genes affected was, however, rather small. Conversely, after short-term exposure to 2-AAF, wild-type and p53.S389A bladders demonstrated a significant number of differentially expressed genes. Differences between wild-type and p53.S389A could mainly be attributed to a delayed, rather than complete absence of, transcriptional response of a group of genes, including well-known p53 target genes involved in apoptosis and cell-cycle control like Bax, Perp and P21. An analysis of differentially expressed genes in non-tumorigenic tissue and bladder tumors of p53.S389A after long-term exposure to 2-AAF revealed 319 genes. Comparison of these with those found after short-term exposure resulted in 23 transcripts. These possible marker genes might be useful for the early prediction of bladder tumor development. In conclusion, our data indicate that lack of Ser389 phosphorylation results in aberrant expression of genes needed to execute vital responses to DNA damage. Post-translational modifications, like Ser389 phosphorylation, seem crucial for fine-tuning the transcription of a specific set of genes and do not appear to give rise to major changes in transcription patterns. As such, Ser389 phosphorylation is needed for some, but certainly not all, p53 functions.

16158176|t|Downregulation of apoptosis revealed by laser microdissection and cDNA microarray analysis of related genes in rat liver preneoplastic lesions.
16158176|a|Regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis plays a key role in tumor development. To elucidate mechanisms underlying hepatocarcinogenesis, patterns of gene expression, including apoptosis-related genes, were compared between glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive preneoplastic foci and surrounding tissue in the rat. Lesions were induced with a single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 200 mg/kg bw) and then 100 ppm 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF)-containing diet combined with two-thirds partial hepatectomy. Frozen sections of the livers were applied for immunohistochemical staining of GST-P, and both positive foci and surrounding negative areas were harvested by laser microdissection. Total RNAs were extracted and amplified with T7 polymerase to allow gene expression analysis by cDNA microarray assays. In the GST-P-positive foci, altered levels were observed for many genes, mostly related to metabolism or catalysis, with increased expression of testosterone-repressive prostate message-2 (TRPM-2), which is reported to act as a protective factor against apoptosis, and decreased expression of thymus-expressed acidic protein (TEAP), which is considered to promote apoptosis. The results indicate that rat liver preneoplastic lesions might be protected against apoptosis and that the approach adopted is useful for clarification of mechanisms underlying hepatocarcinogenesis.
