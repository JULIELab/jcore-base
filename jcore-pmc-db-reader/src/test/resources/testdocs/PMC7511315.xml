Although cardiotoxicity is a serious adverse event associated with several KIs, the reasons remain poorly understood, and its prediction remains challenging. We obtain transcriptional profiles of human heart-derived primary cardiomyocyte like cell lines treated with a panel of 26 FDA-approved KIs and classify their effects on subcellular pathways and processes. Individual cardiotoxicity patient reports for these KIs, obtained from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, are used to compute relative risk scores. These are then combined with the cell line-derived transcriptomic datasets through elastic net regression analysis to identify a gene signature that can predict risk of cardiotoxicity. We also identify relationships between cardiotoxicity risk and structural/binding profiles of individual KIs. We conclude that acute transcriptomic changes in cell-based assays combined with drug substructures are predictive of KI-induced cardiotoxicity risk, and that they can be informative for future drug discovery.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Cardiotoxic adverse events associated with kinase inhibitors are a growing concern in clinical oncology.

There are currently more than 48 KIs approved for clinical use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#x000a0;and other regulatory agencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, and more than 250 KIs are undergoing clinical trials or are in development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The clinical effectiveness of KIs as cancer drugs has led to a broad effort to develop drugs that are more efficacious and have reduced the propensity for adverse events. Cardiotoxicity (CT) is a clinically important adverse event associated with several KIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. KI-associated CT manifests as loss of cardiomyocyte function, which can lead to heart failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Given the extensive therapeutic potential of KIs, approaches to identify and subsequently mitigate the risk for CT during early development of novel KIs and during clinical administration are urgently required.</p><p id="Par4">We do not yet sufficiently understand the mechanisms underlying KI-associated CT. The human kinome consists of more than 500 protein kinases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Given that many KIs exhibit multitarget pharmacology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, inhibition of multiple protein kinases in cardiomyocytes may lead to adverse drug effects such as CT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Overall, however, the general mechanisms of KI-induced CT are still poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Obtaining quantitative clinical risk scores for KI-associated CT is also challenging, as the risk for KI-associated CT has not been systematically studied. The FDA adverse event report system (FAERS) database has been previously applied to quantify the risk of ADRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The FAERS database contains over 9 million individual drug-associated adverse-event reports reported by industry and physicians. Through statistical analyses of the FAERS database, relatively unbiased estimates for the relative risk for specific ADRs can be computed. Such risk scores are clinically relevant as they are based on real-life patient population, and they are not solely based on selected patient cohorts. We previously used such analyses of the FAERS database in combination with systems&#x02019; pharmacology-based approaches to obtain mechanistic insights into adverse-event mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In the current study, generated as part of the NIH-funded Library of Integrated Network Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) Drug Toxicity Signature Generation Center (DToxS), we take a top&#x02013;down global approach to determine if a comprehensive profiling of gene expression changes in human cardiomyocytes can provide insight into pathways associated with KI-induced CT, and to potentially predict the risk of CT. The rationale for this approach is based on the central assumption that CT largely originates from cardiomyocytes where one or more protein kinases contribute to the pathophysiology. Since progression to heart failure takes several months to manifest, it is not immediately obvious if gene expression changes measured after drug treatment for a few days would have predictive value. Thus, a second important assumption is that early changes in gene expression upon drug treatment of cardiomyocytes are indicative of later physiological events. We test the validity of our assumptions by experimentally obtaining gene-expression patterns for the different KIs, and if these patterns could be selectively associated with the clinical risk of CT for each KI, thereby providing gene-expression signatures for KI-associated CT.</p><p id="Par7">We report the generation of transcriptomic profiles from four human primary cardiomyocyte-like cell lines. These profiles are generated using 23 KIs that were FDA-approved and used extensively at the time of experimental design, such that an adequate number of clinical reports have been collected. Drugs are used at their imputed therapeutic concentrations. Through this pan-KI transcriptomic profiling, we obtained insights into the affected pathways that may be related to KI-associated CT. We show that selective patterns of gene expression can be associated with the FAERS-derived clinical risk for KI-associated CT, which may be highly relevant to identify KI drug candidates at risk for showing clinical CT. We also describe the relationships between KI CT risk and structural properties of KIs, highlighting the potential for re-engineering small molecules that exhibit a high risk for CT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Differences in CT risk of kinase inhibitors</title><p id="Par8">In order to obtain unbiased estimates of clinical risk of KI-associated CT, we analyzed individual adverse-event reporting data from FAERS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

We again assessed if drugs caused more than a 20% change in cell viability and mitochondrial stress at the typical clinically used concentration (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

Ranked gene lists for each KI were generated by ranking by differential gene-expression <italic>p</italic> value and keeping the top 250 genes. To assess the similarity between genes present in the top 250 genes for each KI, the Jaccard index was calculated for each ranked list of KI-specific genes, which indicated a limited overlap (&#x0003c;0.25) between the top 250 genes across KIs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Principal component analysis showed variable gene-expression patterns for nine KIs, while for the remaining KIs, little variation in gene expression was seen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), even though these remaining KIs included drugs for which CT is well established.

From the available 23 KIs with the associated clinical CT risk scores, we randomly left out 2 KIs for external validation of the model (test set, 10% of data). The differential gene-expression profiles of 21 remaining KIs were then used to train the model. Given the limited number of available drugs, small changes in expression patterns for drug were expected to affect the identity of the overall set of predictor genes. Therefore, we generated bootstrap datasets by random resampling of KI risk and the associated gene-expression profiles. These bootstrapped datasets were then fit using elastic net models. This first step was performed to identify gene-based predictors that could consistently predict CT risk and contributed significantly to the prediction of this risk. The bootstrap analysis resulted in stable selection of potential predictors. Predictors to be included in the final elastic net regression model were selected based on their minimal root-mean-squared prediction error (RMSE) after cross- validation. Based on this cross-validation, the gene-expression-based predictors in the final elastic net models consisted of 26 genes with the associated variable importance values (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Regression analysis for transcriptomic signatures to predict clinical risk.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Overview of processing and elastic net regression analysis of transcriptomic data in combination with FAERS-derived clinical risk scores. <bold>b</bold> Transcriptomic signature genes selected to predict cardiotoxicity risk score indicating their variable importance. <bold>c</bold> Observed and predicted risk scores from the elastic net cross- validation analysis (mean and standard deviation). <bold>d</bold> External validation of the signature for six kinase inhibitors: regorafenib (REG), sunitinib (SUN), ibrutinib (IBR), lenvatinib (LEN), nintendinib (NIN), and ceritinib (CER).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41467_2020_18396_Fig4_HTML" id="d32e725"/></fig></p><p id="Par18">Repeated cross-validation analyses indicated good predictive performance of the model for left-out KIs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).

We note that the independent validation set was performed 1 year after the original signatures were generated, using a different experimental protocol for the transcriptomic assay that was based on mRNA detection using random primers.

The outlier, ibrutinib, had the lowest, albeit acceptable, predictive performance, with an error of 0.493 between the predicted and observed risk scores. Taken together, the developed signature can be of relevance to support risk prioritization of newly developed KIs. When we tested which of the 21 KIs drove the prediction strength of the model, we found that excluding any of four low-CT risk drugs (cabozantinib, tofacitinib, pazopanib, and erlotinib) increased the error substantially, indicating that these KIs contribute distinct information to the signature.

In this region, we find several KI pairs, in particular, we observe large activity cliffs between afatinib and bosutinib as well as bosutinib and erlotinib. Here, all four compounds have the same chemical core (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b); however, both afatinib and erlotinib show respectively lower CT risk scores compared to bosutinib. We hypothesized that harmonization of drug substructure, similarity, and promiscuity in the context of kinase inhibitor type may inform on our ability to predict CT risk (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">By investigating their KI target profiles, we observe that both afatinib and erlotinib are less promiscuous KIs compared to bosutinib (which is one of the most promiscuous KIs in this set, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>), and they both inhibit EGFR at nanomolar concentrations. On the other hand, less promiscuous KIs, such as lapatinib and gefitinib, exhibit a comparably lower CT risk score (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Indeed, we observe a correlation between kinase inhibitor promiscuity and the observed CT risk score (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). However, KI promiscuity may not be the sole determinant of CT risk. For example, KIs such as imatinib and nilotinib are not as promiscuous as bosutinib; however, both exhibit relatively high CT risk scores. In this case, both imatinib and nilotinib CT may be explained due to their similar chemical structure and high specificity for protein kinases such as DDR1 and ABL.</p><p id="Par23">Finally, kinase inhibitors have distinct binding modes against their targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Kinase inhibitors that bind their kinase targets can be classified based on their binding mode, including the kinase conformation they bind and/or type of interactions they make with their kinase targets (e.g., covalent vs. noncovalent)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. For example, type I inhibitors bind an active kinase conformation, while Type I1/2, II&#x02013;V bind distinct inactive states (Methods); type VI KI binds the kinase target covalently. We do not observe a clear relationship between kinase inhibitor-binding mode and CT. For example, the type II inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib are observed to have a high CT risk, while the type II inhibitors sorafenib and regorafenib have comparatively lower observed CT risk. However, both pairs of inhibitors are highly chemically similar and have similar binding targets. Taken together, the observed CT risk of a KI may be related to both a kinase inhibitor&#x02019;s selectivity and its chemical structure. Furthermore, we observe a relationship between chemical structure and binding target similarity to the predictive performance of our signature (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e&#x02013;g</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par24">The occurrence of drug treatment-associated CT, leading to decreased cardiac function, follows the therapeutic effects of the drugs, and is only observed in a subset of the patients using the drug. This raises the question of whether it would be possible to obtain early cell-based signatures predictive for drug toxicity. Here we addressed this question by attempting associating drug treatment-induced gene-expression patterns with the clinical risk for the adverse events of interest.</p><p id="Par25">By estimating clinical risk from the FAERS database, our method utilizes a relevant and unbiased approach for the quantification of CT risk. As a result, our CT risk scores lack notable pitfalls such as selection bias associated with tightly controlled clinical trials, which underestimate adverse-event risks due to cohort size, trial duration, and selective inclusion criteria for subjects. Nevertheless, there are limitations to the FAERS database as well, which we have discussed and addressed in previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Specifically, use of the FAERS resource may confound demographics information such as age and sex, which was observed not to vary across different KIs. Moreover, CT risk score does not reflect absolute risk for developing CT. Rather, it reflects the relative risk for a subset of patients for which drug-associated adverse events were reported. In addition, there may be some systematic biases based on the sampling frequency of drugs by institution.</p><p id="Par26">It remains unclear if all KIs induce CT through similar mechanisms, and to what extent ultimate clinical pathologies are similar. While the FAERS database allows us to distinguish between different types of CT, the annotation is not uniform and may either refer to distinct pathophysiological descriptions or rather more general clinical presentations of heart failure. To this end, we chose to lump all forms of heart failure, while excluding cardiac AEs that have known and unrelated origin such as coronary artery disease and arrhythmias.</p><p id="Par27">We compared KI-associated transcriptomic response profiles generated from cultured human primary cardiomyocyte-like cells with clinical CT risk scores to obtain a reduced set of genes that may predict the relative risk for KI-associated CT. Using the clinically weighted signatures and the associated regression coefficients identified in the elastic net model, the relative risk for CT can be predicted. The risks predicted by our signatures and the associated regression model can be used in drug development to rank the potential risk of novel KIs with respect to existing KIs with better characterized clinical risks for CT.</p><p id="Par28">The signatures generally showed good prediction of CT risk during cross-validation as well as on an independent set of KIs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), while the only poorly performant KI, ibrutinib, inhibitor of Bruton nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, represents a unique KI in terms of binding mode (i.e., type VI inhibitor) and high promiscuity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Specifically, it is a member of an emerging class of kinase inhibitor drugs that bind their targets covalently (type VI KIs). These drugs are highly underrepresented in the databases used in this analysis, explaining the misclassification of ibrutinib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">The four cell lines we studied are insufficient to fully capture such human variability to KIs. Therefore, in our analysis, we used median fold-change gene-expression profiles across multiple cell lines. The resulting averaged gene-expression profiles thus reflect relatively consistent changes in gene expression across cell lines, i.e., changes in gene expression that are less likely to be highly variable across cell lines, yet may also reflect a set of predictors that may be more consistent in the population. Given that the FAERS CT risk scores also reflect a population-level CT risk, the use of these median values in fold-change gene-expression values is a reasonable starting point for our analyses.</p><p id="Par30">The experimental underpinning of the transcriptomic profiles generated in this study makes them likely to be of value in selecting drug candidates with a low risk for CT as an adverse event. Our analysis is based on primary human heart-derived cardiomyocyte-like cells. Although these cell lines do have phenotypic limitations due to dedifferentiation, the signatures obtained from the cells could be relevant for prediction of clinical drug effects. These cell lines may be reflective of human cardiac pharmacology, i.e., in comparison with animal-derived cardiomyocytes, even though further characterization and standardization are still needed. Detailed characterization of these cell lines is available as metadata to the RNAseq datasets at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dtoxs.org">www.dtoxs.org</ext-link>. Our analyses used drug exposures similar to clinically reported maximum plasma concentrations of the individual KIs, rather than using the same concentrations for all KIs, even though we did not correct for protein binding. We expect that the duration of 48-h exposure may reflect transcriptomic changes that are likely related to early changes in subcellular processes associated with the adverse event of interest.</p><p id="Par31">Unfortunately, in this&#x000a0;study, it is not feasible or ethically possible, due to lack of prior informed consent, to compare cardiac gene-expression signatures with gene-expression profiles from patients who receive KI-therapy and/or who developed KI-associated CT. We considered whether we could compare our gene-expression signatures to cardiac gene-expression data from patients with heart failure who undergo surgery. Typically these are patients with advanced disease, and the gene expression in tissue from advanced disease is not likely to be of relevance to acute drug-induced CT.</p><p id="Par32">By investigating the chemical structure and binding profile similarity of KIs, we are able to observe that chemical components and scaffolds that lead to promiscuous binding of KIs to multiple binding targets are correlated with higher CT values. This is consistent with the notion that a portion of CT risk of KIs can be attributed to higher levels of off-target interactions. Indeed, when we investigate the binding profile of three chemically similar KIs: afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib, we find that their binding profiles are fairly specific compared to other KIs, and they have a lower normalized CT risk score. One limitation we have observed with our approach is that chemically distinct KIs (e.g., in terms of binding profile, substructural similarity, and type), such as the type IV inhibitor ibrutinib, exhibit diminished predictive performance. However, we think that using the guidelines we provide herein, this signature could still assist in the development and prioritization of KIs with lower toxicity risks.</p><p id="Par33">We cautiously anticipate that clinically weighted transcriptomic signatures such as those developed in this study may be of relevance to guide safety assessment in early drug development. Unlike the relatively well-established assessment of electrophysiological safety issues such as QT prolongation, the assessment of non-QT type of CT associated with KI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and other novel drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, lacks reliable biomarkers. The transcriptomic signature for CT identified in this study may help fill this gap, especially if its structure and binding profiles are closely represented within the inhibitors in this study. One could anticipate that after initial selection of promising KIs with apparent efficacy in preclinical screens, transcriptomic profiling using the signatures developed here may possibly be used to rank drugs for the expected CT risk and exclude those with high CT risk scores (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">While beyond the scope of this study, future extension of our studies could explore the idea of studying individualized risk scores for CT. That is, do baseline gene-expression profiles of larger libraries of patient-derived cardiomyocyte cell lines predict the difference in risk for CT between individual patients? Ideally, such an analysis would be conducted using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from patients, who have received KIs and experienced different levels of CT, such as was recently described for anthracycline chemotherapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

A large number of percentiles of these rankings were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. The selection percentile (99.755%) resulting in optimal prediction errors (RMSE) was then used to select a subset of gene-based predictors, and the model that generated the final gene-expression signatures. The selected predictor genes were then ranked by their relative importance, and by their median fold-change values, and displayed as clustered heatmaps. We finally evaluated the predictive value of the resulting regression model to predict CT risk scores for the two left-out KIs.</p><p id="Par44">When using this approach to analyze similar datasets of cardiomyocyte transcriptomes together with risk scores, it is possible that potentially different genes are identified than those described in the current report. This difference associated with the intrinsic property of penalized regression approaches that select predictors from potentially highly correlated sets of predictor candidates. Hence, small changes in either risk scores or gene-expression datasets may affect correlation structures of the data and thereby the list of genes for a signature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Enrichment and network analyses</title><p id="Par45">Enrichment analysis was performed based on a one-tailed Fisher&#x02019;s exact test using R (package stats), in order to identify enrichment of specific genes in predefined gene lists. For enrichment of pathways and biological processes, we used the KEGG database (2016), and for enrichment of protein kinases, we used the KEA database (2015). Diseases were excluded from the KEGG list of processes (e.g., diabetes, depression, and cancer), in order to only evaluate general biological processes or pathways. We used the top 250 DEGs ranked by <italic>p</italic> value for each KI to perform enrichment analysis. Subsequently enriched term <italic>p</italic> values were correlated with CT risk scores to identify kinases and pathways associated with CT risk.</p><p id="Par46">The gene part of the signature for CT identified in the regression analysis was used as seed note to perform a protein&#x02013;protein interaction network (PPI) analysis, conducted using the web application X2K<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, which aims to identify associated kinases and transcription factors based on multiple PPI databases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Calculation of chemical similarity</title><p id="Par47">RDkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rdkit.org">www.rdkit.org</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> was used to generate chemical fingerprints and compute pairwise Tanimoto coefficients (Tc) between the 26 tested kinase inhibitors. For each pair of inhibitors, we first calculated the Tc using four chemical fingerprints, including Morgan_2 2,048-bit (ECFP4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, Morgan_1 2,048-bit (ECFP2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, Daylight-like<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, and MACCS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Because each of these fingerprints capture distinct chemical properties, we computed a weighted Tc average of the three fingerprints: 30% ECFP4, 30% ECFP2, 30% Daylight-like, and 10% MACCS, which exhibited the most optimal spread of the distribution of the pairwise distances. To generate the SAS maps (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), we plotted the pairwise-weighted Tc values with their difference in CT scores (DCT). Finally, 0.35 was set as the threshold for chemical similarity, while half of the maximum difference was set as the threshold for DCS.
