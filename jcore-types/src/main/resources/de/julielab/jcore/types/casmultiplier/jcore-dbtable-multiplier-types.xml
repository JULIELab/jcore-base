    <name>JCoRe File Multiplier Types</name>
    <description>This is a type system for usage with a CAS multiplier. It should not be included into the
        jcore-all-types type system. This particular type system holds a array containing strings that represent the IDs
        of documents to read from database tables. Using an array is used to read batches of document which make
        database access more efficient, for example. Since the primary keys of database tables may have multiple
        elements, a document ID is represented as a StringArray. Multiple tables may be specified in which case
        the tables should be joined on the given document primary keys. This mechanism may be used to read a
        base document and annotations that have been previously created and stored in separate tables. This is
        part of the Jena Document Information System, JeDIS.

            <name>de.julielab.jcore.types.casmultiplier.RowBatch</name>
            <description>A batch of rows of a database table. An array of identifier strings denotes a documents.
                The name of the table to retrieve the IDs from is another feature of this type. The CAS multiplier
                receiving instances of this type must have access to the correct database.

                        additional tables are joined by primary key to the first table. The first table must always
                        be the document data table. The additional tables might hold annotations segmented away
                        from the base document, for example.</description>

                        This feature will be null if the multiplier reader did not read from a subset but directly
                        from a data table..</description>
