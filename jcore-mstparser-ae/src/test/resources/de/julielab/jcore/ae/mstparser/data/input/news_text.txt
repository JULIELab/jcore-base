Migrants drown off Turkish coast

At least 40 migrants have drowned in the Aegean Sea off the western coast of
Turkey, officials say.

The corpses were found washed up on the shore near the city of Izmir. Six
people were rescued, officials told Turkey's Anatolia news agency.

They say the boat was overloaded, carrying more than 60 people when it sank
on Saturday in poor weather.

The Aegean Sea is a major route for illegal immigrants trying to enter the
European Union.

Correspondents say smugglers often take them from the Turkish coast to
nearby Greek islands on fragile, overcrowded boats.

Two of those rescued were reported to be Palestinians.
