   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> underestimated the number of
aircraft flying over the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantex Weapons Plant</ENAMEX> outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amarillo</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, where much of the nation's surplus plutonium is stored,
according to computerized studies under way by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy
Department</ENAMEX>.
</p><p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> counted each flight at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amarillo International Airport</ENAMEX>
once. But military training planes make up to 30 passes per flight
over the plant, according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety
Board</ENAMEX>.
</p><p>
   The secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy</ENAMEX> and local farmers have expressed concern
that a plane crash into a plutonium storage bunker at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantex</ENAMEX> could
spread radioactive smoke for miles. Plutonium, a highly radioactive
element, causes cancer if inhaled.
</p><p>
   The risk of that scenario, previously estimated at one chance in
10 million, is expected to increase when current flight data are
analyzed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this year</TIMEX>, according to a safety board memo dated
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2</TIMEX>.
</p><p>
   ``This doesn't surprise me at all,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trish Neusch</ENAMEX>, who
farms land near the plant 17 miles northeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amarillo</ENAMEX> and 7
miles from the airport. ``We are out there and see these planes all
the time.''
</p><p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike McNulty</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> air traffic manager at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amarillo
International</ENAMEX>, said the previous aircraft count, conducted in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late
1994</TIMEX>, was a ``manual count on a pad,'' done informally by air
traffic controllers.
</p><p>
   That 60-day accounting estimated that 25 planes a day entered
flight patterns over the zone where plutonium is stored in concrete
bunkers covered with earth and grass.
</p><p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pantex</ENAMEX> is operated by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Energy Department</ENAMEX> through a private
contractor and employs 3,600 workers, whose main mission is to
dismantle nuclear warheads. The hollow plutonium ball at the core
of each weapon is stored at the former weapons assembly plant.
</p><p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="Amarillo">Amarillo airport</ENAMEX> averages 250 takeoffs and landings per day,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNulty</ENAMEX> said. About half the aircraft are military planes assigned
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> bases in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Mexico</ENAMEX>, he
said.
</p><p>
   About <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 percent</NUMEX> of the airport traffic enters a flight pattern
over the plutonium storage bunkers, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNulty</ENAMEX> said. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">For the past 14
months</TIMEX>, air traffic controllers have tried to steer planes away
from the bunkers, he said.
</p><p>
   Two of the airport's dozen flight paths are directly above the
nuclear storage area, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNulty</ENAMEX> said. One approach will be eliminated
by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late summer</TIMEX> or <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early fall</TIMEX> when a new instrument landing system
is installed, he said.
</p><p>
   The second flight path cannot be altered until sophisticated
equipment, called VORTAC, is phased out at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas/Fort Worth
Airport</ENAMEX> and installed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amarillo</ENAMEX>, he said. There is no target date
for the transition.
</p><p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNulty</ENAMEX> downplayed the dangers posed by some military traffic by
noting that these planes often fly at high altitudes and stay 2 to
8 miles from the plutonium area.
</p><p>
   ``They are counting something at 35,000 as well as 500 feet,
when in actuality a plane would have to start falling in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma</ENAMEX>
to hit the plant,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNulty</ENAMEX> said. ``They are just collecting a lot
of raw data.''
