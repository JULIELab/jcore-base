AIR ACCIDENTS SPUR MOVE TO ALTER RULES ON SEATING OF BABIES
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By MATTHEW BRELIS
c.1996 The Boston Globe
    The USAir flight attendant in the rear of the plane making a
short flight to Charlotte, N.C., kept peeking around the corner of
a seat in Row 21, making 9-month-old Danasia Brown laugh.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Like most of the two million infants under 2 who fly with their
parents every year, Danasia was traveling for free, seated on her
mother's lap.
</p><p>
   As the DC-9 approached the airport on July 2, 1994, wind shear
slammed the plane to the ground.
</p><p>
   Tywonda Brown's daughter was flung out of her arms. ``I tried to
hold on to her,'' she told federal safety investigators. ``I tried
to hold her and I couldn't.''
</p><p>
   Danasia died of blunt force trauma after being hurled through
the plane at more than 120 miles per hour, battered by several
seats and parts of the cabin. She was one of 37 people to die in
the crash.
</p><p>
   For 16 years the National Transportation Safety Board has tried
to get the Federal Aviation Administration to require that children
under 2 wear child-safety restraint systems, such as those in cars.
</p><p>
   In a letter last May to FAA administrator David Hinson, the
board's chairman, James Hall, referred to Danasia, saying, ``The
Safety Board believes that if the child had been properly
restrained in a child restraint system, she might not have
sustained fatal injuries.''
</p><p>
   ``The Safety Board is disappointed with the FAA's inadequate
actions regarding the required use of child restraint systems,''
Hall wrote.
</p><p>
   The Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing more
than 36,000 flight attendants at 24 airlines, is even more
emphatic.
</p><p>
   ``It is inconceivable, given the strict rules of everything on
the aircraft  A;N;D;MD;  from coffee pots to carry-on baggage  A;N;D;MD;  that must be
tied down or securely stowed for takeoff and landing, or in flight
when the captain thinks it is necessary, that the same
consideration is not given to human beings, even though they are
under the age of 2,'' said Patricia Friend, president of AFA, which
started a public education campaign earlier this year calling for
mandatory use of child restraint seats.
</p><p>
   So far, the FAA, which regulates commercial aviation and ensures
the safety of the flying public, has refused to demand safety seats
for infants.
</p><p>
   In June the FAA released a report to Congress that theorized
many families faced with purchasing a seat for an infant, estimated
to add $200 to the cost of the trip, would take to the highways
rather than fly. Over 10 years, some 82 children whose parents
decided to drive rather than fly, would die in traffic accidents,
the FAA predicted.
</p><p>
   At the same time, the number of infants killed in commercial air
crashes is extremely low. The NTSB attributes the deaths of five
children in the last eight years to lack of safety restraints.
</p><p>
   ``The FAA wants to educate parents rather than mandate a rule,''
said FAA spokeswoman Alison Duquette. ``We would force many parents
with young children onto the road.''
</p><p>
   However, advocates for laws requiring child seats A;N;D;UR;  A;N;D;LR; note that the
airlines fight to keep customers and the industry devised frequent
flier rewards. Proponents of safety seats are confident the
industry would come up with a pricing scheme to keep the one
percent of all passengers who fly with infants.
</p><p>
   The Air Transport Association, representing 21 commercial
carriers, agreed.
</p><p>
   ``It is always difficult as an association to make comments
about pricing because of antitrust laws,'' said ATA spokesman Tim
Neale. ``But certainly, (they) make a good point.''
</p><p>
   While ATA advocated mandates in 1990, it now wants the
government to determine which child seats perform well and which
ones do not before implementing regulations.
</p><p>
   The FAA's civil aeromedical institute in Oklahoma City studied
child restraint systems and found that infants under 20 pounds
should be in aft facing safety seats and children two or older, but
under 40 pounds, should be in front-facing safety seats. Some
safety seats, such as booster seats, belly belts, and normal seat
belts for children under 40 pounds, did not provide adequate
protection.
</p><p>
   ``If you don't have your child restrained, it really doesn't
much matter in a high-impact accident,'' said NTSB investigator
Nora Marshall.
</p><p>
   Henry Hughes, another NTSB survival specialist investigator said
that even at slow speeds, a parent's arms are not
enough A;N;D;UR;  A;N;D;LR; to A;N;D;UR;  A;N;D;LR; restrain a child.
</p><p>
   ``I know it must be very frustrating for parents, particularly
in an emergency, but when it comes right down to it, if the child
is not restrained, there is very little protection,'' said
Marshall.
</p><p>
   Sylvia Tsao found that out with devastating results.
</p><p>
   She and her 22-month-old son, Evan, were on United Airlines
Flight 232 from Denver to Chicago in 1989 when the tail engine blew
apart, resulting in a loss of all hydraulic power needed to control
the airplane.
</p><p>
   The 285 passengers and crew of 10 had more than 30 minutes to
prepare for an emergency landing at Sioux City, Iowa.
</p><p>
   Flight attendants, including Jan Brown-Lohr, instructed
passengers on the brace position and told the parents of the four
lap infants to follow a prescribed procedure of wrapping their
children in blankets and pillows, and placing them on the floor of
the DC-10.
</p><p>
   ``I remember being in the brace position with my son's head
tucked between my knees, my left hand holding his ankle, my face
pushing down on his head, my legs outside his legs,'' Tsao told
investigators.
</p><p>
   ``Suddenly, the world seemed to end. I saw for an instant my
son's body floating and flying at a very high rate of speed down
the right aisle towards the back of the plane, his head first, his
face away from me. He must have been traveling at an incredible
speed.''
</p><p>
   When the plane stopped cartwheeling, Tsao shouted for her son,
but could not go back to where she thought he was. Another
passenger convinced her to leave the plane, which was quickly
filling with a choking smoke. It was the smoke, an autopsy
revealed, that killed Evan, not injuries from the crash.
</p><p>
   Brown-Lohr, a Manchester, N.H., native stayed in the plane until
the smoke forced her out.
</p><p>
   ``When I left, Sylvia was the first person I saw in the
cornfield,'' Brown-Lohr recalled in an interview. ``She was trying
to go back to the plane. I stood in front of her and said, `You
can't go back.' She said she had to get her son and then said, `You
told me to put my baby on the floor and I did and now he's gone.'
</p><p>
   ``At that point, I didn't have any feeling at all. The hair on
the back of my neck stood up and I knew that I would have to live
with that for the rest of my life.
</p><p>
   ``I know what my responsiblity is: to keep every passenger in
the cabin safe. I cannot do that if a child is sitting on a lap.
The agency with responsibility for airline safety is the FAA and
they are not doing their job.''
</p><p>
   Since the crash, Brown-Lohr has worked to have child seats
mandated, either by the FAA or through legislation. Next month, she
said she will come to Boston to give United crew members letters to
send to their representatives urging action.
</p><p>
   Brown-Lohr has not spoken to Tsao since their encounter in the
cornfield. Tsao, who now lives in New Mexico, declined to comment
about the accident. Brown says she hopes to speak with Tsao one
day.
</p><p>
   ``I am waiting until we succeed with this campaign. I couldn't
do anything for him that day, but this is what I can do and it
could give his life some meaning.''
</p><p>
   Some parents have voluntarily started buying seats for their
infants under two  A;N;D;MD;  and Brown-Lohr praises them every time she sees
one on a flight.
</p><p>
   But Tywonda Brown was told it was not necessary.
</p><p>
   ``They told me I could hold her on my lap. I would have paid for
her to sit in a seat,'' she said. ``I would have given my life for
her. She wasn't here that long. She just turned nine months old.''

   Shortly after Fossett's launching Monday his competitors sent
him telegrams of congratulation.
</p><p>
   The British balloon, called the Virgin Global Challenger, is to
be flown by Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways;
Per Lindstrand, chairman of Lindstrand Balloons Ltd. of Oswestry,
England, and an Irish balloonist, Rory McCarthy.
</p><p>
   Branson and Lindstrand, who have set several ballooning records,
were the first pilots of hot-air balloons to cross both the
Atlantic Ocean, in 1987, and the Pacific, in 1991.
</p><p>
   Lindstrand said that because of unfavorable weather patterns
over England he and his colleagues had decided to launch their
Virgin Global Challenger from a military airfield at Marrakech,
Morocco.
</p><p>
   To move the big crew capsule, balloon and accessories, the
British group chartered a Beluga transport plane  A;N;D;MD;  a modified
Airbus 300 similar to the Pregnant Guppy aircraft used by NASA to
transport large rocket components. The flight to Morocco is
scheduled for Friday, and Lindstrand said the balloon launching
would probably take place a day or so later.
</p><p>
   Branson, chairman of the multifaceted Virgin Group, which
includes Virgin Atlantic Airways, believes that his competitor,
Fossett, faces grave risks.
</p><p>
   ``Because his capsule is not pressurized,'' Branson said in an
interview, ``Steve will have to stay at around 20,000 feet, which
is usually well below the core of the jet stream. That could slow
him down a lot. We will be at 30,000 to 35,000 feet, where our
chances of riding the high-speed jet stream are much better.
</p><p>
   ``Steve is incredibly brave, and if anyone should beat us, I'd
rather it was he.''
</p><p>
   The Dutch team, led by Henk Brink, recently tested the inflation
of its Unicef Flyer balloon at Cape Kennedy in NASA's huge Vehicle
Assembly Building, where space shuttles are prepared for flight.
Brink, who intends to launch his balloon from Nijmegen, the
Netherlands, is a helicopter instructor and veteran balloonist.
</p><p>
   In 1986, he, his wife, Evelien, and William Hageman, a Dutch
fighter pilot, became the first European balloonists to cross the
Atlantic; so precise was their navigation that they landed within a
few miles of Brink's home in the Netherlands.
</p><p>
   Although balloons must travel in the same direction as the wind
that carries them along, a pilot can navigate to some extent by
changing altitude to seek wind headed in the desired direction.
Even a small change in altitude can result in a large change in
direction.
</p><p>
   The Unicef Flyer flight suffered a setback Dec. 26 when its
third crew member, Wouter Bakker, resigned from the flight crew
``for personal reasons.''
</p><p>
   Days before the expected launching this week, Brink said in an
interview that he had advertised for a replacement, stipulating
that the third crew member should be an airline captain.
</p><p>
   ``We're down to three candidates,'' Brink said Friday, ``and all
of them are completely familiar with our navigation and
communication equipment. For the launch and landing, I will do the
piloting.''
</p><p>
   All three teams are flying Rozier balloons  A;N;D;MD;  a type that has
achieved many long-distance records in recent years.
</p><p>
   A modern Rozier is kept aloft by helium gas, but to add extra
lift, the balloon is compartmentalized and the lower part can be
filled with hot air from a gas burner. This enables the balloon to
maintain altitude at night, when cold air and the lack of sunlight
cools the helium and lessens its lifting power.
</p><p>
   Since the first manned balloon flight in 1783 by Jean Francois
Pilatre de Rozier and the Marquis Francois Laurent d'Arlandes in a
Montgolfier hot-air balloon, many balloonists have attempted
round-the-world flights, but all have failed, and some have died
trying.
</p><p>
   Five unsuccessful attempts were made by a single team led by
Larry Newman of Scottsdale, Ariz., in his Earthwinds balloon before
Newman abandoned his efforts one year ago.
</p><p>
   The Rozier balloon is named after its inventor, who was forced
to use inflammable hydrogen in his 18th-century version, since a
century was to pass before the discovery of nonflammable helium.
Rozier was killed in 1785 while trying to cross the English
Channel; his hydrogen-and-hot-air hybrid balloon caught fire and
crashed.
</p><p>
   From that time until 1960, balloonists relied almost exclusively
on hydrogen or helium for lift, since hot-air burners were regarded
as too dangerous.

BOEING DENIES MAGAZINE REPORT ON 777 CONCERNS
(For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
By KAREN WEST
c.1996 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SEATTLE  A;N;D;MD;  A Business Week report questions the safety of
Boeing's new 777 jetliner and says the company has been in a
``contentious debate'' with federal aviation officials over
possible design flaws.
</p><p>
   Thursday night, Boeing vigorously defended the company's newest
airplane and sharply criticized the magazine for publishing ``an
article with conclusions based on innuendo, hearsay and anonymous
sources.'' The company also said the magazine refused an invitation
for a briefing.
</p><p>
   In its latest edition out Thursday, Business Week says senior
Federal Aviation Administration officials downplayed the safety
concerns of their own engineers in certification tests on the 777.
The story also says that for more than two years FAA officials have
been engaged in a debate with Boeing over possible design flaws in
the aircraft's engines.
</p><p>
   Quoting mostly unidentified sources, the article says FAA
engineers feared that if a fan blade on one of the 777's engines
broke during flight, the engine would become unbalanced and produce
vibrations that could cause the aircraft to lose stability.
</p><p>
   ``It's an issue of safety,'' one unidentified FAA engine
specialist is quoted as saying. ``It could lead to catastrophe.''
</p><p>
   The magazine also quotes anonymous FAA sources who question
whether the airplane has been adequately tested.
</p><p>
   In reply, Boeing said: ``No one is more interested in building a
safe airplane than Boeing and we stand behind the safety and
reliability of our products. No airplane in history has been tested
as thoroughly as the Boeing 777.''
</p><p>
   The magazine says numerous sources told it during a four-month
investigation that pressure to meet Boeing's planned certification
date led the FAA to overrule safety concerns.
</p><p>
   Business Week reports that Boeing executives refused to comment
for the article, but Boeing spokeswoman Donna Mikov said the
magazine never acknowledged an offer for background briefings on
the certification process.
</p><p>
   She said Business Week approached Boeing with ``preconceived
data that had not been researched thoroughly.''
</p><p>
   ``It is clear to Boeing that Business Week only wanted answers
to specific speculative questions without prior knowledge and
background on the Boeing 777 project or the certification
process,'' Mikov said.
</p><p>
   In the article, senior FAA officials in Washington, D.C., defend
the aircraft and the agency's safety review process.
</p><p>
   Sandra Allen, assistant FAA administrator for public affairs in
Washington, D.C., said Thursday that the agency had not yet read
the piece but that ``the record is clear that the testing and
analysis of the B-777 were unprecedented in their scope and
breadth.
</p><p>
   ``The certification process for this aircraft exceeded 125,000
staff hours by technical experts at the FAA. The agency maintains
complete confidence in the certification process.''
</p><p>
   The three makers of engines for the 777  A;N;D;MD;  Pratt A;N;D;AMP; Whitney,
General Electric and Rolls Royce  A;N;D;MD;  also denied any problems, the
magazine says.
</p><p>
   But the magazine says there are serious concerns about the size
and weight of the fan blades in the 777 engines.
</p><p>
   Fan blade breaks have been reported in 24 other jet airliners
since 1990, the article said. Although no crashes have resulted
from such breaks, the magazine says FAA safety experts fear that
with the greater size and weight of the 777's blades, a break might
shake the cockpit so badly that pilots could not read the flight
instruments, increasing the risk of a crash. Despite the worries,
the FAA sources say Boeing appears to have done only limited
testing to see how the 777 would react if a blade broke.
</p><p>
   Boeing officials maintain they cooperated fully with the FAA
``in conducting the most rigorous laboratory, ground and flight
testing program in the history of commercial aviation.''
</p><p>
   The company added: ``We stand behind that process and fully
support the regulatory agencies in meeting the stringent
requirements for testing and certifying all versions of the Boeing
777.''
</p><p>
   Boeing's 777, a $4 billion aircraft, is the world's largest
two-engine passenger jet. Its engines are the largest ever made for
a commercial airplane and have unusually heavy fan blades  A;N;D;MD;  48
pounds in the largest configuration. The outer portions of 777
engines are so big that the body of a Boeing 737 could fit inside
one.
</p><p>
   Because the 777 is equipped with two engines instead of four,
airline pilot and passenger groups initially voiced concerns about
flying the computer-designed aircraft on long-range, over-water
routes.
</p><p>
   But last May when the FAA gave the 777 unprecedented approval to
fly extended-range twin-engine operations, known as ETOPs, those
same groups praised it as one of the most technologically advanced
in aviation history.
</p><p>
   As a result of Boeing's flight-test program  A;N;D;MD;  which included
1,000 takeoffs and landings to simulate a year's worth of
commercial service for one plane  A;N;D;MD;  FAA officials said the 777 would
be ``the finest, most reliable and safest airplane ever
delivered.''
</p><p>
   During its testing program, Boeing was required to prove that,
in the event of a single-engine failure, the 777 could safely
continue flying for up to three hours.
</p><p>
   The 777, which began commercial service last June with a flight
from London to Washington, D.C., has captured more than 80 percent
of the worldwide market for its class of aircraft since 1990,
according to Boeing.

JULIAN HILL, 91, WHO DISCOVERED NYLON
(lb)
By DAVID STOUT
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Julian Hill, a research chemist whose accidental discovery of a
tough, taffylike compound revolutionized everyday life after it
proved its worth in warfare and courtship, died on Sunday in
Hockessin, Del. He was 91.
</p><p>
   Hill died at the Cokesbury Village retirement community, where
he had lived in recent years with his wife of 62 years, Polly.
</p><p>
   During the late 1920s, Hill was a member of a Du Pont Co. team
studying the behavior of certain molecules that chain together to
form larger ones, called polymers. The chemists were engaged in
pure research, though finding a substitute for silk was in the back
of their minds.
</p><p>
   In 1930, while trying to create ever larger structures by
adjusting the amount of water in a batch of carbon- and
alcohol-based molecules, the team came up with a concoction that Du
Pont's research head, Wallace Carothers, thought useless.
</p><p>
   But Hill was intrigued after sticking a heated glass rod into a
beaker containing the material and finding that it stretched and
pulled, like taffy, and that it became silky when stretched at room
temperature. Soon, Hill and his colleagues were playing with the
material in the corridor and finding that it could be shaped into
strands that were remarkably long and strong.
</p><p>
   The substance, of course, was nylon, although it would not be so
named until it was introduced at the 1939 World's Fair in New York
 A;N;D;MD;  hence, the ``ny'' in nylon.
</p><p>
   ``I tell my wife I was something better than a good scientist,''
Hill recalled in an interview years later. ``I was lucky.'' Since
Du Pont held the patents to nylon, Hill made no great fortune off
the discovery, but his wife said Wednesday that the company had
treated him well over the years.
</p><p>
   (A sad footnote is the fate of Carothers. Beset by personal
problems that fueled depression, thinking himself a failure despite
a brilliant career, he committed suicide in 1937 at the age of 41.)
</p><p>
   If the development of nylon was in part serendipity, it was not
a total surprise. Almost a decade earlier, at an American Chemical
Society conference in Buffalo, N.Y., Hill and Carothers reported on
progress in developing ``artificial silks'' like rayon, which was
then coming into use.
</p><p>
   But rayon is derived from cellulose and in that sense is not
strictly synthetic, as is nylon. Nylon was used initially for
toothbrush bristles, fishing line and surgical sutures. Nylon
stockings were first sold in 1939. They cost twice what silk
stockings did, and women were happy to pay. Nylon stockings were
sheer and strong.
</p><p>
   The material was deemed so important that its use was restricted
to the military after the United States entered World War II. Nylon
was used to make rope, tents, aircraft tires and parachutes.
</p><p>
   It also served to improve British-U.S. relations, in a way.
Young American soldiers stationed in Britain made a good impression
on their dates by giving them nylon stockings, available from the
military's post exchanges when they could not be bought elsewhere.
</p><p>
   The reintroduction of nylon to civilian life after the war
caused a sensation, and at least one stampede. A crowd of 10,000
people jammed a San Francisco department store in 1945, causing the
nylon sale to be called off.
</p><p>
   In the decades since, nylon has become ubiquitous, as carpeting
and clothing. And about two-thirds of all the luggage manufactured
in the world is made from it.
</p><p>
   Scientists consider nylon a benign product of technology,
because it has not been found to have any deadly side effects. But
Hill, who loved wildlife and was a dedicated bird-watcher, said in
a 1988 interview that he thought ``the human race is going to
perish by being smothered in plastic.''
</p><p>
   Julian Werner Hill was born in St. Louis, graduated from
Washington University there in 1924 and earned a doctorate in
organic chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1928. His wife recalled on Wednesday that his doctoral studies were
delayed a year because he was stricken with scarlet fever.
</p><p>
   Hill played the violin and was an accomplished squash player and
figure-skater until his early 40s, when an attack of polio weakened
one leg, his wife said.
</p><p>
   Before his retirement from Du Pont in 1964, Hill supervised the
company's program of aid to universities for research in physics
and chemistry.
</p><p>
   Surviving besides his wife are a daughter, Louisa Spottswood of
Philadelphia; two sons, Joseph, of Villanova, Pa., and Jefferson,
of Washington, and five grandchildren.

BOEING AIRLINER CRASHES IN CARIBBEAN WITH 189 ABOARD (UPDATE2)
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By Michael Molinski
c.1996 Bloomberg Business News
   (Updates with latest body total, no survivors found; adds that
search was called off for the night, with in second and third
paragraphs; adds report that lightning stuck the craft, German
Foreign Ministry comment response, in seventh paragraph.)
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Feb. 7 (Bloomberg) -- A
chartered Boeing 757 carrying German tourists from the Dominican
Republic crashed into the Caribbean sea last night, leaving no sign
that any of the 189 people on board survived.
</p><p>
   The U.S. Coast Guard in Miami said it recovered 79 bodies in the
area of the crash, before suspending its search at nightfall today.
It plans to continue the search in the morning.
</p><p>
   ``We'll continue searching until there is reason to believe
there are no survivors,'' said Petty Officer Scott Carr, a
spokesman for the Coast Guard, this evening. ``We still maintain
hope that somebody is out there and we will try to find them.''
</p><p>
   Searchers did find some life rafts, but no survivors, the Coast
Guard said. It wasn't clear whether the rafts were dragged out by
survivors or if they inflated on impact.
</p><p>
   U.S. and Dominican Republic officials said the cause of the
crash was unknown. The owner of the German tour agency that
chartered the plane was quoted by Reuters as saying lightning
struck the Frankfurt-bound 757.
</p><p>
   Vural Oeger, head of Hamburg-based Oeger Tours, said he was told
by Dominican aviation officials that the plane's engines were
damaged by lightning. Reuters also said the pilots apparently tried
to turn the plane around to return to the airport, but were unable
to and plunged into the Caribbean.
</p><p>
   A spokeswoman for the German Foreign Ministry said that while
she'd heard rumors of lightning causing the wreck, she couldn't
confirm the reports.
</p><p>
   The plane crashed just before midnight local time last night,
about five minutes after taking off from the Puerto Plata airport
in the Dominican Republic. Coast Guard officials said rain and
sharks were hampering the rescue efforts.
</p><p>
   A spokesman for the Seattle-based Boeing Co. said it was sending
a team to help investigate the crash.
</p><p>
   The aircraft, owned by Turkish company Birgen Air, was leased to
Alas de Transporte Internacional, a Dominican charter airline that
operates mainly during the peak winter season when European
tourists visit the resort town of Puerto Plata, said a spokeswoman
for Aeronautica Civil, the Dominican Republic's aviation agency.
</p><p>
   Oeger had chartered the plane from Alas.
</p><p>
   The aircraft, built in 1985, carried 176 passengers, most of
them German tourists, and 13 crew members -- 11 Turkish nationals
and two Dominicans.
</p><p>
   Russ Young, a Boeing spokesman, said the investigation could
last weeks or months.
</p><p>
   The jet was the 31st Boeing 757 made and was originally sold to
Eastern Air Lines, of Miami, which became a subsidiary of Texas Air
Corp. after filing for bankruptcy in 1989.
</p><p>
   Martin Brodie, a spokesman for Rolls-Royce Plc in London, said
the plane was fitted with Rolls-Royce RB211-535 engines. He said
the power plant was ``one of the most reliable engines in
service.''
</p><p>
   The company had no idea yet what went wrong and there was no
immediate evidence that the engines were to blame.
</p><p>
   The crash was the second of a 757 in less than two months. On
Dec. 20, an American Airlines jet crashed in the mountains near
Cali, Colombia, killing 160 of the 164 people on board. The cause
of that crash is still under investigation.
</p><p>
   The Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola
with Haiti, is the most popular Caribbean destination for Germans.
Hundreds of thousands of German tourists visit the island each
year, attracted by its low prices and tropical beaches.
</p><p>
   Oeger is one of a number of discount tour agencies in Germany
which charters planes to the Dominican Republic.

   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  A Boeing 757 carrying 189 people, mostly tourists
on their way home to Berlin and Frankfurt from the Dominican
Republic, crashed into the Atlantic late Tuesday about 13 miles
offshore. At least 105 bodies were recovered, American officials
said.
</p><p>
   Debris was spread in an area two miles long and 150 yards wide,
the United States Coast Guard said, suggesting that the jet broke
up before it hit the water.
</p><p>
   But an official at the German Embassy in Santo Domingo, the
capital of the Dominican Republic, said the fuel had not caught
fire, indicating that the plane had not exploded.
</p><p>
   The official, the first secretary at the embassy, said bad
weather was likely the cause.
</p><p>
   ``More than 50 percent, it was the interference of bad
weather,'' the official, Klaus D. Brock, said in a telephone
interview. The plane had taken off from Puerto Plata, about 100
miles northwest of Santo Domingo.
</p><p>
   The crash was the second recent loss of a Boeing 757 in flight:
In December a 757 crashed near Cali, Colombia; pilot error appears
to have been the primary cause.
</p><p>
   Aviation officials in Puerto Plata gave conflicting information
Wednesday about the flight, which reached an altitude of about
7,000 feet before crashing.
</p><p>
   Gen. Hector Ramon, head of the civil aviation agency, said the
pilot had radioed the tower that he had a problem and was
returning, news reports said. But Maj. Emmanuel Souffront, of the
Dominican Air Force, said a transcript of radio communication with
air traffic controllers indicated there had not been a problem.
</p><p>
   ``The aircraft started to turn to the right and disappeared from
the radar screen,'' he was quoted as saying.
</p><p>
   ``Before it went down, someone radioed from the aircraft, `Stand
by.'''
</p><p>
   In Berlin and Frankfurt, friends and family of the passengers
arrived at the airports to find flags flying at half staff and
teams of doctors, psychologists and clergy to meet them.
</p><p>
   The 11-year-old plane, originally built for Eastern Air Lines,
was owned by a Turkish company and under lease, with a crew, to a
Dominican airline, Alas de Transporte Internacional, for a single
flight. It carried 176 passengers, including 4 children. Eleven of
the crew were Turkish and two Dominican.
</p><p>
   The Turkish company, Birgen Air, was using the plane to fill a
charter commitment to a German company, Oger Tours of Hamburg.
Wolfgang Schwalm, a spokesman for the Frankfurt airport, said the
Boeing 757 had replaced a Boeing 767 at the last minute because the
767 had technical problems.
</p><p>
   In Istanbul, the general manager of Birgen said on television
that he believed the plane had been hit by lightning. But the jet
is designed to withstand any such strikes.
</p><p>
   The United States Coast Guard dispatched three cutters to help
retrieve bodies. Germany sent two civil aviation officials and
three officials from the federal police in Weisbaden to help
identify bodies.
</p><p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said it would send experts
to assist investigators, and the National Transportation Safety
Board said it would send investigators if more evidence became
available.
</p><p>
   But it was not clear who would pay to retrieve the plane's data
recorder from the wreckage, off the north coast of the Dominican
Republic where the water is about 3,000 feet deep. Retrieval could
cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Though the plane was
American built, neither it nor the airline nor the flight was under
American jurisdiction, and no Americans were on board.
</p><p>
   Nevertheless, American safety experts said they would be very
interested in learning more about the crash if it was caused by
mechanical problems or by weather.

NAVY TO HUNT FOR BLACK BOX FROM AIR CRASH
(HLW)
By MATTHEW L. WALD
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UPPER MARLBORO, Md.  A;N;D;MD;  The Navy said here on Thursday that it had
shipped equipment to the Dominican Republic to help find the flight
data recorder of the Boeing 757 that crashed offshore on Tuesday
night, killing all 189 people on board.
</p><p>
   Navy officials said they had been asked to locate the so-called
black box, but so far have not been asked to help retrieve it or
any other parts of the wreckage. In the meantime, discussions
continued about who would pay to salvage parts of the jet.
</p><p>
   The Turkish-owned charter jet, which was leased to a Dominican
airline, was carrying German tourists home from a Caribbean
vacation when it plunged into the Atlantic shortly after takeoff
from Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic.
</p><p>
   Late on Thursday afternoon in Puerto Plata, the Coast Guard said
it had given up its search, and it remained uncertain exactly how
many bodies had been accounted for.
</p><p>
   Dominican officials said 128 bodies had been recovered. A
Pentagon spokesman said local people in boats appeared to have
stripped some bodies of money and identification.
</p><p>
   After the crash, the Dominican Republic asked for help from the
National Transportation Safety Board, which in turn called in the
Navy.
</p><p>
   Capt. Raymond Scott McCord, supervisor of the Navy's salvage and
diving operations, said at a briefing here on Thursday that the
Boeing 757 went down in an area where the water is from 1,000 feet
to 13,000 feet deep, with the sea bottom flat in some parts and
jagged in others.
</p><p>
   Although McCord said the Navy had retrieved wreckage in more
challenging places, he declined to predict the likelihood of
success in recovering the black box in this case, or what it would
cost.
</p><p>
   The black boxes on passenger jets are equipped with metal
cylinders that emit a ``ping'' sound when immersed in water.
</p><p>
   So far, the Navy has sent a Towed Ping Locator System, also
known as a tow fish, to the area. The device is pulled on a cable,
about 2,500 feet above the ocean floor, at 2 to 3 knots, and,
depending on water conditions, it can hear the pinger on the black
box at a distance of up to a mile.
</p><p>
   Navy officials and aviation experts plan to review air traffic
control radar and other data in an effort to narrow the search
area. When they finish, probably on Tuesday or Wednesday, they will
begin surveying the ocean, he said.
</p><p>
   ``Looking for anything on the ocean floor is very difficult,
because you are working blind,'' he said. ``The analogy is a needle
in a haystack. But with a pinger locator, you know which side of
the haystack you're looking at.''
</p><p>
   The Navy also showed off a bigger robot probe that would carry
out the next step, making sonar maps of the bottom, to locate the
debris fields. A third remote-controlled device, with video and
still cameras and manipulator arms, would then be sent down. All
three are towed by a ship, and the Navy is now negotiating with
commercial ship owners for a suitable vessel, McCord said.
</p><p>
   No one would say what such an operation would cost.
</p><p>
   At the National Transportation Safety Board, Michael Benson, a
spokesman, said, ``any costs are expected to be incurred on a
cost-sharing basis.''
</p><p>
   ``We certainly have a strong interest in that aircraft; it's our
aircraft,'' he said.
</p><p>
   ``There are others who have an equally strong interest,'' he
said, citing ``countries and corporate entities.'' These would
apparently include Germany, Turkey, the Dominican Republic, Boeing,
Alas de Transporte Internacional, which leased the plane, and
Birgenair, a small Turkish company that owned the plane and
provided the crew.

FAA UNDERESTIMATED NUMBER OF FLIGHTS OVER PLUTONIUM STORAGE AREA IN
PANHANDLE
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
By HOLLACE WEINER
c.1996 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration underestimated the number of
aircraft flying over the Pantex Weapons Plant outside Amarillo,
Texas, where much of the nation's surplus plutonium is stored,
according to computerized studies under way by the Energy
Department.
</p><p>
   The FAA counted each flight at Amarillo International Airport
once. But military training planes make up to 30 passes per flight
over the plant, according to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety
Board.
</p><p>
   The secretary of Energy and local farmers have expressed concern
that a plane crash into a plutonium storage bunker at Pantex could
spread radioactive smoke for miles. Plutonium, a highly radioactive
element, causes cancer if inhaled.
</p><p>
   The risk of that scenario, previously estimated at one chance in
10 million, is expected to increase when current flight data are
analyzed later this year, according to a safety board memo dated
May 2.
</p><p>
   ``This doesn't surprise me at all,'' said Trish Neusch, who
farms land near the plant 17 miles northeast of Amarillo and 7
miles from the airport. ``We are out there and see these planes all
the time.''
</p><p>
   Mike McNulty, the FAA air traffic manager at Amarillo
International, said the previous aircraft count, conducted in late
1994, was a ``manual count on a pad,'' done informally by air
traffic controllers.
</p><p>
   That 60-day accounting estimated that 25 planes a day entered
flight patterns over the zone where plutonium is stored in concrete
bunkers covered with earth and grass.
</p><p>
   Pantex is operated by the Energy Department through a private
contractor and employs 3,600 workers, whose main mission is to
dismantle nuclear warheads. The hollow plutonium ball at the core
of each weapon is stored at the former weapons assembly plant.
</p><p>
   The Amarillo airport averages 250 takeoffs and landings per day,
McNulty said. About half the aircraft are military planes assigned
to Air Force bases in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and New Mexico, he
said.
</p><p>
   About 25 percent of the airport traffic enters a flight pattern
over the plutonium storage bunkers, McNulty said. For the past 14
months, air traffic controllers have tried to steer planes away
from the bunkers, he said.
</p><p>
   Two of the airport's dozen flight paths are directly above the
nuclear storage area, McNulty said. One approach will be eliminated
by late summer or early fall when a new instrument landing system
is installed, he said.
</p><p>
   The second flight path cannot be altered until sophisticated
equipment, called VORTAC, is phased out at Dallas/Fort Worth
Airport and installed in Amarillo, he said. There is no target date
for the transition.
</p><p>
   McNulty downplayed the dangers posed by some military traffic by
noting that these planes often fly at high altitudes and stay 2 to
8 miles from the plutonium area.
</p><p>
   ``They are counting something at 35,000 as well as 500 feet,
when in actuality a plane would have to start falling in Oklahoma
to hit the plant,'' McNulty said. ``They are just collecting a lot
of raw data.''

HUGHES DELAYS CHINA SATELLITE SHIPMENT AFTER EXPLOSION (UPDATE1)
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
c.1996 Bloomberg Business News
   (Updates with additional information about future launches,
crash failure.)
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Beijing, Feb. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Hughes Aircraft Corp., the
satellite-making arm of General Motors, delayed shipment of a new
satellite to China after this morning's launch failure by a Chinese
rocket, a company official said.
</p><p>
   ``It's been delayed,'' said K.C. Lang, a Hughes executive in
Beijing. ``It's been held off and we don't know when it's coming.''
</p><p>
   This morning's launch failure, in which a rocket exploded
shortly after lifting off, cast doubt on whether China will be able
to complete an ambitious schedule of satellite launches.
</p><p>
   ``There may be adjustments to our future plans because of the
accident,'' said Zhang Lihui, a spokesman for the rocketmaker,
China Great Wall Industry Corp. ``I can't tell you anything about
the possible changes now.''
</p><p>
   The next launch -- of a Hughes-built Apstar-1A communications
satellite -- is scheduled for mid-March aboard a Long March 3
rocket built by China Great Wall.
</p><p>
   The customer is the APT Satellite Co. of Hong Kong, whose
shareholders include commercial arms of the Chinese army, space and
telecommunications authorities, Singapore Telecom and Thailand's
Charoen Pokhpand Group.
</p><p>
   A Long March 3-B rocket carrying an Intelsat satellite exploded
as it was being launched just after 3.00 a.m. today, showering
debris on the Xichang launch site in southwest China's Sichuan
province.
</p><p>
   The rocket apparently exploded after rising just a few hundred
feet from its launch pad, crashing down on a road one mile away.
There are no reports of injuries.
</p><p>
   China Great Wall officials in Beijing said company executives
are locked in discussions in the capital and at the Xichang space
base to determine what went wrong.
</p><p>
   It was the first launch for the heavy payload-carrying Long
March 3-B vehicle, China Great Wall's Zhang Xiaolin said.
</p><p>
   Clean-up operations to contain the spillage of hazardous
chemical wastes have begun. Numerous calls to Xichang failed to
reach any officials.
</p><p>
   China's satellite launch track record has been patchy. In
January 1995, a Long March 2-E rocket exploded one minute into its
flight, destroying the Apstar-2 satellite it carried.
</p><p>
   China competes with American, European and Russian launchers on
the basis of price.
</p><p>
   An agreement last year between Washington and Beijing was to
have curtailed Chinese price cutting to a maximum of 10 percent
under U.S. launch costs for proven vehicles.
</p><p>
   ``If the launch is successful, it will be terrific,'' the
official Beijing Youth Daily yesterday quoted China Great Wall
senior engineer Long Lehou as saying. ``However, if it fails, the
consequences will be disastrous.''
</p><p>
   The failure delivered a blow to a group including Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. and Tele-Communications Inc. that planned to
use the spacecraft to beam television signals to Latin America. The
satellite was built by Loral Corp. of New York for Intelsat.
</p><p>
   The explosion is likely to raise the cost of insuring future
launches, analysts said. Shanghai-based China Pacific Insurance Co.
insured the Apstar-1A satellite for 2.3 billion yuan ($280 million)
on Monday, the official China Daily reported Tuesday.
</p><p>
   ``Maybe the insurance policies will increase a lot for the Long
March family,'' said Li Ming, chief of the international business
department at China Pacific Insurance.
</p><p>
   The 2-E and the untested 3-B versions of the Long March rockets
are considered by foreign analysts to be less reliable than the
Long March 3, which has had only one failure in more than 20
launches.
</p><p>
   The 2-E rockets are used to propel satellites into low orbits of
about 200 kilometers above the planet, while the 3-series rockets
can enable satellites to reach orbits out to 35,000 kilometers.
</p><p>
   This was to have been China's busiest year of satellite
launches.
</p><p>
   After next month's planned launch, China plans to launch another
of its DongFangHong3 satellites on a Long March 3-A rocket in by
May.
</p><p>
   In May or June, a satellite for U.S.-based EchoStar
Communications Corp. is due to be launched on a Long March 2-E.
Last December, China successfully launched an Echostar satellite
from Xichang, the most recent Chinese success.
</p><p>
   In July, a Long March 3 rocket is to scheduled to carry a
ChinaSat-7 communications satellite for a Chinese-controlled
company. The satellite is to be built by Hughes Aircraft Co.
</p><p>
   In July-August, China plans to launch a recoverable spy
satellite aboard a Long March 2-C rocket from its Jiuquan launch
base in northern Gansu province.
</p><p>
   Later in the year, China hopes to win a bid to launch the
Mabuhay communications satellite for a Manila-based consortium led
by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. The satellite is to be
supplied by U.S.-based Loral Corp.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN F-14S TO STAND DOWN FOR REVIEW OF ACCIDENTS
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By Bill Arthur
c.1996 Bloomberg Business News
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Washington, Feb. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Navy ordered its Northrop
Grumman Corp. F-14s out of the skies for three days while it
investigates three recent F-14 crashes.
</p><p>
   The action came after an F-14A fighter crashed today in the
Persian Gulf. The two crew members ejected and were rescued and
returned to the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz with minor injuries,
the Navy said.
</p><p>
   Sunday, an F-14D crashed into the Pacific Ocean off southern
California, killing its two crew members. And on Jan. 29, an F-14A
crashed into houses in Nashville, Tennessee, after takeoff, killing
the two crew members and three people on the ground.
</p><p>
   The cause of today's crash is undetermined.
</p><p>
   ``In light of the recent mishaps involving F-14As and Ds, the
Navy has ordered a 72-hour safety standdown for all F-14
aircraft,'' said Lt. Greg Geisen, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon.
</p><p>
   ``Although different models of the F-14 have been involved in
these mishaps, it is prudent to temporarily suspend routine flight
operations for all F-14s in order to assess the available
information and determine if procedural or other modifications to
F-14 operations are warranted,'' the Navy said.
</p><p>
   A one-time exception to the standdown will be allowed for 14
F-14s on board the USS America, which is returning to the United
States from the Persian Gulf and Bosnia, Geisen said. Those planes
will be permitted to fly to Oceana Naval Air Station, Virginia, as
the ship nears port.
</p><p>
   The F14 ``Tomcat'' is the Navy's first-line fighter aircraft. It
has two-engines and is capable of action in all weather, day or
night. The Navy has about 330 F-14s in three models, As, Bs and Ds.
</p><p>
   The models differ mainly in engines and avionics. The A model
uses engines from Pratt A;N;D;AMP; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies
Corp. The B and D models use General Electric engines.
</p><p>
   The Navy said there have been F-14 32 crashes since 1991. That
figure isn't uncommon for Navy jet fighter aircraft, Geisen said.
</p><p>
   The aircraft was introduced to the fleet in the mid 1970s, and
has undergone several upgrades since then, Geisen said. The planes
were made by Grumman Corp., now Northrop Grumman, principally in
Calverton, New York, on Long Island. The company delivered the last
F-14 to the Navy in 1992, said Northrop Grumman spokesman John
Vosilla. He referred all questions about today's crash to the Navy.
</p><p>
   Aviation safety and engineering experts will review the data
from the three recent crashes and are to present their findings to
the Chief of Naval Operations Mike Boorda in three days, Geisen
said.
</p><p>
   Northrop Grumman shares were up 3/8 to 66 1/4 at midday.

NAVY GROUNDS F-14'S AFTER THIRD RECENT CRASH
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By CHRIS BLACK
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  The Navy suspended operations for its entire fleet
of F-14 airplanes Thursday after the third ``Tomcat'' crash in a
month  A;N;D;MD;  the second in a week.
</p><p>
   The 72-hour ``safety stand-down'' came shortly after an F-14
fighter from the USS Nimitz crashed during flight operations in the
northern Persian Gulf at about 6:30 a.m. EST.
</p><p>
   The Navy announced that the two Naval aviators on board were
rescued by a SH-60 helicopter after they ejected from the aircraft.
The Navy said that both men were in good condition. One aviator
suffered minor abrasions. The Navy is investigating the cause.
</p><p>
   Another Tomcat crashed off the coast of California during
exercises on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson on Sunday. Both crew
members were killed. Late last month, an F-14 crashed near
Nashville, killing both crew members and three civilians on the
ground.
</p><p>
   Although the crash Thursday was the third Tomcat crash this
year, Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the Navy had
uncovered no evidence of a flaw in the aircraft.
</p><p>
   A safety stand-down is a procedure the military uses to conduct
an intensive review. During this three-day period, the three
classes of F-14s will stay out of the air so Navy personnel can
review maintenance procedures and equipment, plus check each
aircraft for weaknesses or deficiencies.
</p><p>
   The F-14s on the deck of the USS America will be allowed to fly
off because the aircraft carrier is returning from a deployment.
Carrier decks are routinely cleared of aircraft the day before the
carrier docks.
</p><p>
   ``We do not know what has caused these three crashes this
year,'' Bacon said. ``The goal of the stand-down is to take a time
out to look at everything involved with the F-14s.
</p><p>
   Adm. Jeremy Boorda, the chief of Naval Operations, informed
Deputy Defense Secretary John White of the latest crash Thursday
morning and told him he was ordering the standdown for the entire
fleet of more than 300 aircraft, Bacon said.
</p><p>
   ``What the Navy is trying to do is find out what caused these
accidents,'' Bacon said.
</p><p>
    A;N;D;UR;  A;N;D;LR; In the past five years, 32 F-14s have crashed. One of the
Navy's first female pilots, Lt. Kara Hultgren, died while trying to
land an F-14 on an aircraft carrier in 1994. The Navy concluded
that engine failure caused that crash.
</p><p>
   The Tomcat, a $38 million, twin-engine aircraft built by the
Grumman Aerospace Corp., is the standard fighter plane used by the
Navy for close-in air combat. The aircraft has been in operation
since 1973. The oldest version of the aircraft, the F-14A, is
scheduled to be phased out by the year 2004.
</p><p>
   The crash rate for the F-14 dropped dramatically after the
initial years of deployment and has generally gone down since then
except for occasional spurts of accidents, according to Naval
records.
</p><p>
   Bacon said the Navy had no single explanation for the increases
in F-14 accidents.
</p><p>
   ``The Navy informs me that they have been unable to find a
common thread to these accidents,'' Bacon said. ``This is a
mystery.''

   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  The U.S. Navy ordered all of its F-14s out of the
skies for at least three days after one of them crashed on Thursday
in the Persian Gulf, the third crash of an F-14 in the last month.
</p><p>
   The two-man crew survived the crash, ejecting into the northern
waters of the gulf, and were rescued and returned to the carrier
Nimitz.
</p><p>
   The two crewmen, who were not identified, were reported to have
suffered minor injuries.
</p><p>
   The three-day shutdown of the Navy's fleet of more than 330
F-14s was ordered by the chief of naval operations, Adm. Jeremy M.
Boorda, who said in an interview at the Pentagon that while there
was no immediate evidence of a connection among the three crashes,
``This is an airplane that we worry about.''
</p><p>
   ``A jinxed airplane?'' he said. ``No. But known deficiencies in
the earlier models? Yes, and we're working on that, including some
changes to the aircraft.''
</p><p>
   He said the three-day review might result in new restrictions on
use of the plane, nicknamed the Tomcat, which has the highest
accident rate for jet fighters in the Navy fleet. Ten F-14s have
gone down in the past two years, and 32 since 1991. Each plane
costs more than $30 million.
</p><p>
   ``We may come out with some more operational restrictions, but
it's way too early to say that,'' the admiral said. ``This is too
serious a business to be guessing about.''
</p><p>
   Navy officials said that during the shutdown, special engineers
and other safety experts would review the evidence available from
the three recent crashes and inspect the rest of the fleet for
defects in the planes, in their maintenance, or in pilot training.
</p><p>
   Earlier models of the fighter, called the F-14A, were plagued
with engine problems when they entered the Navy's fleet of
carrier-based jet fighters in 1973. Specifically, the engines used
on the first model were not powerful enough for a fighter of its
size.
</p><p>
   The Navy was forced to impose strict restrictions on how pilots
could operate the aircraft, and had to replace many of the engines.
Two of the three planes that have crashed since late January were
F-14As.
</p><p>
   The engines installed in later models, the F-14B and the F-14D,
were more powerful and have proved more reliable. Despite the
troubles of the F-14 fleet, the rate of accidents among all Navy
fighter planes has come down dramatically in recent years, a record
that has made the recent spate of crashes all the more alarming.
</p><p>
   In the first of the crashes this year, an F-14A crashed into a
residential neighborhood in Nashville, Tenn., on Jan. 29, seconds
after takeoff. The two-man crew was killed, along with three people
on the ground. The pilot was involved in another F-14 crash in
1995.
</p><p>
   Last Sunday, the crew of an F-14D was killed when the fighter
plunged into the Pacific off the coast of Southern California
during exercises.
</p><p>
   The F-14 that crashed on Thursday had flown from the Nimitz,
which is sailing in the Persian Gulf to enforce a no-fly zone over
southern Iraq, an operation that dates from the end of the 1991 war
in the gulf. Navy officials said that the plane was on a routine
training mission. They would not speculate on the cause of the
crash.
</p><p>
   The plane, which was manufacutred by the Grumman Corp. of Long
Island, has gone out of production, and the Navy has begun to phase
out the plane entirely, replacing it with the F-18.

JET THAT CRASHED IN COLOMBIA REPORTEDLY STRIPPED OF PARTS
(HLW)

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  Scavengers have descended on the wreckage of the
American Airlines jetliner that crashed in Colombia last December,
making off with more than 500 parts, including the jet engines, the
landing gear, and electronic components for possible sale to other
carriers, the airline said.
</p><p>
   A spokesman for the airline said that to its knowledge, no parts
of the plane had yet been offered for sale, and on Thursday the
Federal Aviation Administration said it was notifying other
airlines of the possibility.
</p><p>
   Not long after the Boeing 757 jetliner crashed last Dec. 20 in a
remote mountain area near Buga, Colombia, killing 160 of the 164
people on board, the Colombian authorities said people were taking
valuables from the bodies of the dead passengers as well as the
luggage.
</p><p>
   Last month, the airline sent other airlines and aviation
companies an 11-page list of the missing parts and their serial
numbers along with a letter warning: ``These parts could pose a
significant safety risk should they be installed on other aircraft
since they were involved in a crash.''
</p><p>
   John Hotard, a spokesman for American, said by telephone: ``You
may have a part that looks perfectly good on the outside, but if
you get into some of the sophisticated testing, you may find out
it's not good.''
</p><p>
   Although the plane was a Boeing 757, flying from Miami to Cali,
many of the parts would also fit a Boeing 767.
</p><p>
   The airline's letter, first reported in The Cleveland Plain
Dealer, noted: ``Any part taken from the crash site and/or offered
for sale without the express written approval of American Airlines
Inc., should be considered a stolen aircraft part.'' It cited
sections of federal law that made such activity illegal and
threatened that any supplier caught handling any of the parts would
be barred from doing business with American.
</p><p>
   Hotard said that American was not interested in the salvage
value of the parts but that some could be sold for a lot of money
if passed off as being in good condition. Testifying before a
Senate aviation subcommittee last June, federal investigators said
various small parts of airplanes that are worth hundreds of dollars
in new condition, are available for a few dollars from scrap
dealers in the United States and may find their way back into
airplanes, although the parts are not suitable.
</p><p>
   The local Colombian authorities did retrieve the black boxes
with cockpit voice and flight data recordings, and technicians at
the National Transportation Safety Board in Washington have
analyzed them. The safety board and the Colombian authorities
recently said there did not appear to be any mechanical problem
with the plane before the crash.
</p><p>
   That means that the stolen parts would probably not be useful in
determining the cause of this crash. In some other crashes,
investigators have sorted through tons of debris to find components
that offer clues.
</p><p>
   Stealing parts from crash scenes is not new. When a Colombian
DC-8 cargo plane crashed on Feb. 5 in Asuncion, Paraguay, killing
23 people, local television showed a man stealing engine parts from
the debris, The Associated Press reported. In the United States,
crash scenes are usually cordoned off, in part to protect the
evidence and to prevent the spread of blood-borne infection.
</p><p>
   A spokesman for the Boeing Co., Richard F. Schleh, said the
company had helped American distribute its letter, which he
described as ``a very good precautionary effort.''
</p><p>
   Margaret Gilligan, the deputy associate administrator for
regulation and certification at the aviation agency, said the
agency did not believe that parts had been stolen from planes that
had crashed in this country, but she said the agency did not know
what happened abroad.
</p><p>
   William A. Machado, who heads an FAA program to investigate
aircraft parts that are counterfeit or come from unapproved
suppliers, said of the American letter: ``It's the first time I've
seen it, but I can understand their concern, because they really
didn't have a lot of control.'' Machado called the letter ``a
responsible action on their part.''

NAVY RESTRICTS FLIGHTS OF TROUBLE-PLAGUED F-14
(kd)
By PHILIP SHENON
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  The Navy imposed new restrictions Saturday on
pilots who fly the F-14 jet fighter, after three of the
trouble-plagued jets crashed in the last month, killing four Navy
airmen and three civilians.
</p><p>
   While the Navy said it had found no common thread in the recent
crashes, it announced that it had placed temporary limitations on
the speed at which F-14s could be flown, and on the use of
afterburners, which give a plane extra thrust by injecting fuel
into hot exhaust gases.
</p><p>
   All F-14 pilots will also be required to undergo refresher
safety courses before they are allowed to fly again, a requirement
that could keep some grounded for several more days.
</p><p>
   The Navy made the announcement as it ended a three-day worldwide
shutdown on operations of the carrier-based F-14 Tomcat.
</p><p>
   In recent years the Navy's fleet of more than 330 F-14s has
suffered a series of catastrophic accidents, including a crash on
Jan. 29 in which one of the early models of the fighter, an F-14A,
smashed into a residential neighborhood in Nashville, killing the
two-man crew and three civilians on the ground.
</p><p>
   On Feb. 18, one of the latest models, an F-14D, went down off
the coast of southern California, killing its two-person crew.
</p><p>
   On Thursday, an F-14A crashed into the Persian Gulf; the pilot
and radar operator survived with only minor injuries.
</p><p>
   The F-14 has the highest accident rate among Navy combat planes,
and its problems have mounted even as the overall safety record for
Navy planes has improved dramatically in recent years. Ten F-14s
have gone down in the past two years, and 32 since 1991. Each plane
costs more than $30 million.
</p><p>
   In announcing the three-day halt to operations last week, the
Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, said that the
F-14 was ``an airplane that we worry about.'' Earlier models of the
plane had engines that were not powerful enough for a fighter of
its size, which led to restrictions on their use and, in some
cases, replacement of the engine.
</p><p>
   In a statement Saturday, the Navy said that the new restrictions
on speed and on the use of afterburners would remain in effect
until the investigations of the three recent crashes had ended. The
statement did not rule out permanent restrictions in the future.
</p><p>
   ``It should be emphasized that the investigations continue to
determine causes and any permanent corrective action required,''
the Navy said. ``The requirements and limitations placed in effect
today are intended to permit safe operation of the F-14 aircraft
pending completion of the investigations.''
</p><p>
   Under the restrictions, F-14 fighters cannot fly more than 550
nautical miles an hour, below an altitude of 10,000 feet.
Restrictions on the use of afterburners apply to later models of
the plane.
</p><p>
   Navy officials said Saturday that the restrictions would not
affect the plane's usefulness, since the limitations would be
immediately waived in combat. ``If a pilot is out there and needs
to fly his airplane, he's going to fly his airplane as he needs
to,'' said a Navy spokesman.
</p><p>
   The House National Security Committee has announced that
hearings would be held next week on the safety record of the F-14.
The panel is expected to hear testimony from Navy officials, pilots
and representatives of the manufacturer, the Grumman Corp., which
merged with Northrop in 1994.
</p><p>
   The two House Republicans who are sponsoring the hearings,
Duncan Hunter and Randy Cunningham, both from California, said in a
statement that ``too many lives and too much equipment has been
lost'' in F-14 crashes. Although the plane's problems precede the
Clinton administration by many years, the lawmakers said that they
planned to investigate whether the administration ``is underfunding
both the readiness and modernization of Navy aircraft.''

NTSB TESTS BORROWED 737 IN CRASH PROBE
(For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
By BILL VIRGIN
c.1996 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SEATTLE  A;N;D;MD;  The National Transportation Safety Board is borrowing
a Boeing 737 from Seattle's Museum of Flight as part of its
investigation into why a similar jetliner crashed near Pittsburgh
in 1994.
</p><p>
   The museum's aircraft, ironically enough, was donated by USAir,
which operated the airplane that crashed, killing 132 people on
board.
</p><p>
   The board is testing the plane's rudder controls to learn why
Flight 427 suddenly rolled and crashed while on its approach to the
Pittsburgh airport Sept. 8, 1994. Aviation safety investigators say
a sharp movement of the rudder  A;N;D;MD;  the movable vertical piece in the
plane's tail  A;N;D;MD;  could have caused the jet's deadly roll.
</p><p>
   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall is to address a briefing on the
investigation in Seattle Thursday, but board spokesman Mike Benson
said Hall isn't expected to announce any findings.
</p><p>
   Benson said investigators are simulating air loads on the 737's
rudder. ``It's a slow, methodical job since we don't have adequate
black boxes,'' he said.
</p><p>
   Newer models of flight data recorders, or ``black boxes,'' would
record the angle of the rudder and the pedal controlling it. But
because the plane was reduced to debris by the force of the crash,
and the 737 was equipped with older-model flight recorders that
didn't measure such information, investigators are running tests to
``surmise'' rudder and pedal position, Benson said.
</p><p>
   Installation of improved flight recorders was an official
recommendation of the board after earlier hearings into the
Pittsburgh crash.
</p><p>
   Museum of Flight spokesman Bill Hayes said the plane, donated
last September, was to be partially dismantled as an exhibit. The
NTSB was looking for an intact plane on which to conduct tests, so
the museum delayed its plans.
</p><p>
   The tests are being conducted at a Boeing hangar at Boeing
Field. No airborne tests are planned.
</p><p>
   The NTSB also conducted tests last September to determine if
wake turbulence from another plane could have contributed to the
crash. Benson said those results are still being analyzed.

RARE TESTING ON A 737 SEEKS ELUSIVE ANSWERS TO A CRASH
(bl)
By MATTHEW L. WALD
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  Air safety investigators have begun highly unusual
tests on a parked Boeing 737, forcing parts askew with hydraulic
arms and clipping vital control cables in an effort to determine
why a sister plane owned by USAir fell out of the sky near
Pittsburgh in September 1994.
</p><p>
   The investigation of that crash, which killed all 132 people on
board, is already the most extensive in the history of the National
Transportation Safety Board. And in a way it is the most worrisome,
because the 737 is the most popular jet in the sky.
</p><p>
   The board finds the cause of almost all crashes by looking at
the wreckage, the flight data recorders, radar records and similar
evidence. But in this case, that has not been enough in this case.
</p><p>
   ``What we're doing to this airplane is unprecedented,'' said
James Hall, the safety board's chairman.
</p><p>
   Hall said investigators had already invested more than 50,000
hours of engineering time in trying to find the cause of the crash,
making the inquiry the longest and costliest in the board's 29-year
history.
</p><p>
   The 737 that crashed was approaching Pittsburgh when it abruptly
rolled to the left and plunged to the ground at 300 miles an hour.
</p><p>
   Investigators say that its trajectory through the sky can be
explained by a sustained swing of the rudder  A;N;D;MD;  the moveable surface
on the vertical tail  A;N;D;MD;  and by nothing else that they can identify.
</p><p>
   It is not clear, though, how the rudder could have
malfunctioned.
</p><p>
   So technicians have pulled the floor out of the passenger cabin
of the test plane, enabling them to see the cables that link the
pedals at the pilot's feet with the rudder in the back of the
plane.
</p><p>
   If the cables do not snap because of the forces applied to them
during the tests, engineers will cut them and measure the sound.
The goal is to try to duplicate sounds captured by the cockpit
voice recorder just before the crash, and to see what effect a
snapped cable might have had on the plane.
</p><p>
   The investigators are using a plane that USAir had removed from
service and is planning to donate to the Museum of Flight, in
Seattle. The museum is across a runway from a Boeing plant, and
Boeing is assisting in the new experiments.
</p><p>
   The plane that crashed carried an early-model flight data
recorder, which captured only 11 kinds of data. It did not record
the position of the rudder or of the rudder controls. In contrast,
newer data recorders capture dozens of kinds of data, and usually
point investigators toward the root of the problem very quickly.
</p><p>
   For example, the recorder in the Boeing 757 that crashed off the
coast of the Dominican Republic last month had 72 kinds of data.
</p><p>
   Speaking by telephone from Seattle as the tests began Thursday,
Hall said, ``I just hope the aircraft industry and the Federal
Aviation Administration will take appropriate action so we are
never in a position again where it would take us this much time and
effort.''
</p><p>
   But the airlines argue that wiring planes to capture more data
would require taking them out of service for long periods, at high
cost.
</p><p>
   The plane being used for the new tests has been extensively
outfitted with instruments. ``It looks like somebody on life
support,'' said Hall, referring to the bundles of wires that are
now attached.
</p><p>
   Investigators are looking for some combination of problems on
three systems that can move the plane: the main rudder-control
mechanism, a backup mechanism and a yaw damper, which is a
computer-operated automatic system that makes small adjustments in
the rudder to keep the plane's nose and tail lined up in precisely
the direction that the plane is moving.
</p><p>
   One reason for the new tests is that investigators say they may
not fully understand the significance of an event that occurred
just before the crash: the USAir plane ran over the wake of a
Boeing 737 flying 4.2 nautical miles ahead.
</p><p>
   Such wake encounters are common, but investigators think this
one may have put a force on the plane that somehow triggered a
fatal chain of events.

LATEST CRASHES RENEW CONCERNS ABOUT AVIATION SAFETY
(For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
By BILL VIRGIN
c.1996 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SEATTLE  A;N;D;MD;  Commercial aviation worldwide is off to a rocky start
in 1996, with two major crashes this month alone claiming 312
lives.
</p><p>
   Other forms of transportation aren't faring much better. In the
United States alone, railroad accidents have accounted for 19
deaths, 226 injuries and more than $62 million in damage, National
Transportation Safety Board Chairman James Hall said this week.
</p><p>
   And while crashes of airline flights get the most attention,
general aviation is usually deadlier. Last year, the NTSB says, 732
people died in general aviation accidents, compared with 175 deaths
from accidents involving scheduled U.S. airlines. For the worst
carnage, America's highways are still unrivaled, with 40,000 deaths
reported from motor vehicle accidents each year.
</p><p>
   Still, news of jet crashes renew questions and concerns about
aviation safety, particularly when it comes in spates and
particularly in a city like Seattle, home to the world's biggest
manufacturer of commercial jet aircraft.
</p><p>
   The crash of a passenger jet anywhere ``is something that
galvanizes attention,'' said John Nance, an aviation safety expert
and writer.
</p><p>
   The latest crash  A;N;D;MD;  that of a Faucett Airlines-operated Boeing
737 in Peru, which killed 123 aboard  A;N;D;MD;  came on the heels of an NTSB
news conference in Seattle this week detailing its lack of success
in finding a cause for two U.S. crashes of Boeing 737s, one in
1991, the other in 1994.
</p><p>
   Those two crashes are linked by the remaining mystery of the
cause, the fact both involved 737s and the suspicion both crashes
may be linked to a sudden movement of the rudder, sending the
planes into uncontrollable rolls.
</p><p>
   But there seems to be little commonality in the three most
recent crashes, either by plane type or suspected cause. The crash
of an American Airlines Boeing 757 in Colombia in December, which
killed 160 people, occurred as the plane was approaching the
airport; pilot error is suspected.
</p><p>
   A Feb. 6 crash of a Birgen Air-owned Boeing 757 occurred as the
plane was taking off from the Dominican Republic; that crash
claimed 189 lives. Authorities in the Dominican Republic say the
recorded air speed indicator at the time the plane stopped climbing
was much higher than what ground radar showed, which would suggest
pilots thought they were going faster  A;N;D;MD;  and had more power to climb
 A;N;D;MD;  than they actually did.
</p><p>
   The investigation has just begun in the Peru crash, but some
witnesses say the plane was on fire before it hit the ground.
</p><p>
   Nance said there's no apparent common thread running through
those three accidents. ``The only other common denominator (would
be) the human factor, and it's been known for a long time that
human factors account for 90 percent of accidents,'' he said.
``It's still the thing that gets us. We're getting better at it,
but we're not as perfect as the machines we build.''
</p><p>
   Boeing has assisted in the investigation of the Dominican
Republic crash and spokesman Russ Young said a team is being sent
to Peru.
</p><p>
   Until the Colombia crash, the 757 hadn't been involved in any
fatal crashes in its 13 years of flying. The 737, which in various
models has been in service for 28 years, is the world's
best-selling commercial aircraft.
</p><p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration hasn't issued any directives
in relation to the three most recent crashes. ``It's way too early
for that,'' said FAA spokesman Tim Pile. ``We would need some kind
of formal finding, unless it was really obvious there was some
problem with the aircraft.''
</p><p>
   Last year, the International Civil Aviation Organization
reported, there were 26 accidents involving scheduled aircraft,
resulting in 710 fatalities; that was down from 941 the year
before.

<p>
   Miami, March 6 (Bloomberg) -- Lufthansa flight 463 was miles
above the Georgia coast when Leonard Krys had a heart attack.
</p><p>
   Nitroglycerine from the plane's medical kit didn't relieve the
passenger's severe chest pains. Yet, the Lufthansa pilot, instead
of landing, kept the plane on course to Frankfurt.
</p><p>
   Eight hours later when the plane landed, the 47-year-old Krys
was rushed to a hospital. He survived -- and sued. Last month a
federal judge in Miami ordered the German airline, Deutsche
Lufthansa AG, to pay Krys $2.7 million for, among other things, its
negligence on the 1991 flight.
</p><p>
   Judge Linnea Johnson noted Krys suffered permanent heart damage
and can expect a shorter life because he was denied prompt medical
care.
</p><p>
   ``Leonard Krys is a changed man,'' Johnson wrote.
</p><p>
   Such disregard for the health of its passengers isn't just a
public relations nightmare for carriers like Lufthansa. It could
open airlines to the kind of liability they face when a plane
crashes and passengers are killed or hurt.
</p><p>
   ``This decision may act as the catalyst'' for people to file
similar lawsuits, said Howard Shafran, a lawyer specializing in
aviation wrongful death law.
</p><p>
   Gregg Bloche, an M.D. and professor at Georgetown University Law
Center agrees. ``Certainly plaintiffs lawyers will pay attention,''
Bloche said. ``They are entrepreneurs and it's a well functioning
market.''
</p><p>
   Bloche said he has been asked to help sick passengers on planes
four times and is ``amazed at how uninformed the flight attendants
seemed.''
</p><p>
   The Lufthansa case has prompted some carriers to reexamine
whether their aircraft and crews are equipped to deal with medical
emergencies.
</p><p>
   ``Airlines may be more inclined to turn around an airliner with
a sick passenger,'' said Columbia University Law School Professor
David Leebron, although so-called mercy landings aren't uncommon
now.
</p><p>
   And as part of a study, the Federal Aviation Administration is
looking at whether airliners needed better medical equipment.
</p><p>
   Nonetheless, Chris Chiames of the Air Transport Association, an
industry trade group, said there is a limit to what airlines can
do. ``Our responsibility isn't to be a flying hospital,'' he said.
</p><p>
   Critics say the industry can do better. The FAA requires
airliners to have a first-aid kit on board, as well as a medical
bag with a stethoscope, syringes and other devices. The bag can be
used by a doctor -- if one is on board as a passenger.
</p><p>
   Joan Sullivan Garrett, founder of a Phoenix-based company that
provides ground-to-air emergency medical advice, says U.S. carriers
should train flight attendants in basic medical techniques and
equip planes with emergency oxygen tanks and heart monitors.
</p><p>
   While U.S. airlines defend the current level of medical service,
some foreign carriers are doing more voluntarily.
</p><p>
   Eventually, lawyers say, if enough airlines install improved
equipment it creates a higher standard for the industry. Airlines
that don't keep up could face liability problems.
</p><p>
   Sydney-based Qantas Airlines and Virgin Atlantic Airways, the
British carrier, equip their planes with automatic defibrillators.
The devices monitor a heart attack victim and provide a reviving
jolt when needed.
</p><p>
   British Airways Plc is in the process of installing equipment to
monitor a person's vital signs and send information to a medical
crew on the ground.
</p><p>
   Qantas, which installed defibrillators in 1991, said they've
been used 50 times and saved two lives.
</p><p>
   But ``Qantas and Virgin alone can't be considered a standard,''
said Daniel Cathcart, a Los Angeles attorney specializing in
representing victims of air crashes. ``You couldn't say the
standard in the industry is a defibrillator and that if you had one
my father would have lived.''
</p><p>
   Courts give pilots leeway in making judgments about mercy
landings. Northwest Orient Airlines -- now Northwest Airlines Inc.
-- was sued in the late 1980s after a 66-year-old woman had a heart
attack on a flight from Anchorage, Alaska, and died in a hospital
shortly after reaching Chicago. Her relatives said the pilot should
have landed earlier. The court ruled the pilot made a reasonable
decision, given that two doctors on board said the woman's
condition was stable.
</p><p>
   Lufthansa wasn't so lucky. Judge Johnson concluded there were
more than enough red flags to warrant an emergency landing. Johnson
also took Lufthansa to task for not asking ground personnel for
medical advice.
</p><p>
   Krys, a Miami travel agent, was flying to Germany at the
invitation and expense of Lufthansa. Feeling pains shoot through
his chest and arm, Krys began dripping with sweat about 90 minutes
after take-off, said his lawyer, Tod Aronovitz of Miami.
</p><p>
   Soon he was short of breath and was having trouble speaking.
Krys walked the aisle with his arms raised above his head to ease
the pain. When Krys went to the plane's galley to lie on the floor,
flight attendants made him return to his seat, Aronovitz said.
</p><p>
   A young German gynecologist returning from a vacation gave Krys
nitroglycerine, but Krys continued to writhe in pain, according to
court testimony. The gynecologist periodically gave him oxygen.
</p><p>
   One passenger sitting near Krys testified she put a blanket over
her head so she wouldn't have to watch him die.
</p><p>
   Lufthansa, which appealed the decision, declined to comment.
</p><p>
   Krys's son, Alex Krys, flew to Germany and stayed with his
father for three weeks while he recovered in a hospital. But their
nightmare with Lufthansa wasn't over.
</p><p>
   Since Leonard Krys's return ticket was on Lufthansa, the father
and son decided to fly home on the carrier. But Lufthansa, knowing
Krys's medical condition, wouldn't let him on board without a
doctor. So, Alex Krys said, he hired one.
</p><p>
   ``I expected them to extend a courtesy ticket (for the doctor)
after what had happened,'' the younger Krys said.
</p><p>
   No such luck -- Krys even had to pay a half-fare for his
father's oxygen tank.

TROLLHATTAN, Sweden: to do,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Butler-Wheelhouse, a South African who spent more than 20 years
working for Ford Motor Co., said the investment had benefited GM,
too. Saab has given GM access to a market that car makers crave  A;N;D;MD; 
affluent, well educated, young and professional  A;N;D;MD;  a market GM has
failed to entice with Cadillac.
</p><p>
   GM has also gained from Saab's reputation for technical
expertise, grounded in its origins as an offshoot of a military
aircraft maker. GM now uses Saab climate- and emissions-control
systems as well as its engine turbocharging technology. ``We're
small, but we have a great level of technical skill,''
Butler-Wheelhouse said.
</p><p>
   That skill was recently shown in a new system that reduces a
car's emissions after a cold start of the engine to well below the
strict standards scheduled to take effect in California in several
years.
</p><p>
   Also, GM and Saab have collaborated on a new headrest that
reduces the risk of whiplash in an accident. A mechanical system,
which is activated by any sudden burst of pressure, moves the head
restraint forward to cradle the head before it snaps back.
</p><p>
   But the most anticipated new product is the car that Saab
intends to introduce next year for its 50th anniversary. ``There's
a lot riding on that new car,'' Jones said. ``It's a bad cliche and
a pun, but in this case it's true.''
</p><p>
   The car is a big secret, but executives do drop a few hints. It
will have sedan and station wagon versions, but, contrary to trade
reports, Butler-Wheelhouse said it would not replace Saab's
12-year-old hatchback sedan.
</p><p>
   Robert J.H. McEniry, a Saab vice president of marketing,
suggested that the new car would aim at a buyer willing to spend
more than the $32,000 required today for a basic Saab 900, someone,
perhaps, who would consider buying a 5-series BMW or a Mercedes
E-class.
</p><p>
   At a recent auto show in Geneva, Saab displayed two ``concept''
cars, high-performance permutations of the 900 coupe and
convertible. They offered a tantalizing taste of what is likely to
come.
</p><p>
   Painted in bright, bold colors wrapped around a sleeker, more
solid silhouette and featuring more power, higher torque and an
improved chassis, the cars made their cousins, parked discreetly
off to one side of the exhibit, look like sparrows.
</p><p>
   But marketing such a car will present several challenges. First,
understatement is a quality admired by typical Saab buyers, so too
much hype and flash may alienate the customer base.
</p><p>
   Also, Saab means different things in different markets. In
Europe, it is linked to its aircraft heritage. But in the United
States, Saab evokes visions of an absent-minded professor sporting
a tweed jacket and pipe and tooling around in an orange 900 made in
1968.
</p><p>
   ``We started working two years ago to bring greater consistency
to the brand worldwide, to McDonald-ize it, if you will,'' McEniry
said. ``We have to give customers security that what they're buying
in the brand is the same no matter where they bought the car.''
</p><p>
   To that end, the company is using some sales techniques akin to
those of GM's Saturn division. It recently started offering free
one-hour at-home test drives in some American cities, featuring
delivery of a car by a Saab technician who will answer questions
but will not make a sale.
</p><p>
   In Geneva, it is testing a new dealership design whose stark
white walls warmed by cherry wood accents and tile floors evoke an
Italian boutique. After viewing the cars, buyers are ushered behind
a ``confidentiality screen'' to discuss a purchase. Salespeople are
called hosts, and the nearby service center is undergoing a
metamorphosis intended to make the repair experience more personal.
</p><p>
   Saab dealerships are getting more than a face lift, however. In
the United States, which accounted for more than a quarter of
Saab's sales last year, the company lacks strong dealers in five of
the 11 markets that account for 85 percent of the nation's sales of
imported luxury cars, a fact that infuriates Butler-Wheelhouse.
``We're weak in Los Angeles, which is car country,'' he said. ``If
we had the same penetration there that we have in the Northeast,
we'd be well on our way to achieving our sales goals.''
</p><p>
   The effort to reach out to the heights of the market runs
counter to the prevailing trends in auto manufacturing. Mercedes
and BMW have both focused their sights lower, increasing their
offerings of smaller, less expensive models in a bid to pump up
sales.
</p><p>
   But industry experts say Saab may have no choice other than to
aim high, since the small-car market is overwhelmed now with bigger
European and Asian competitors.
</p><p>
   ``Right now, they're caught in the middle,'' said Robert Spano,
who follows the industry for Ludvigsen Associates in London. ``On
the one side, there's Mercedes and BMW, and on the other, GM, Ford,
Volkswagen and the rest. They need to decide which camp they're
going to be in and get out of the middle.''
</p><p>
   Saab has clearly elected to take the high road of Mercedes and
BMW. But that creates a conundrum because the market for
premium-priced cars is minuscule, the very opposite of what is
needed by a company in search of a 50 percent sales increase.
</p><p>
   But Butler-Wheelhouse reckons on more opportunity there than
elsewhere. People do not want to drive just any car, he says. ``You
don't want your newspaperman delivering your paper in the same
brand of car you drive,'' he said. ``I don't like to criticize my
competitors, but I think BMW is starting to have that problem by
reaching too far down to get volume.''
</p><p>
   As confident as he is in Saab's strategy, Butler-Wheelhouse is
well aware of how high the hurdle is for Saab. Last year, it missed
its sales goal of 100,000 cars. Spano, the analyst, says European
car makers will be lucky to increase their sales by 2 percent to 3
percent this year.
</p><p>
   If Saab falters, it may face the unpleasant prospect of being
taken off the GM life-support system. ``There may be a window when
we start thinking about the next new car, when they will pause to
reconsider what they're doing with this company,''
Butler-Wheelhouse said. ``We have to make sure they don't have a
reason for doing so.''

LONG-LOST RING RAISES WORLD WAR II GHOST
(For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)
By LINDA HELSER
c.1996 The Arizona Republic
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   When a blackened sterling-silver ring popped up like a ghost
from the vintage debris, Bob Lasher was stunned.
</p><p>
   Poking around with a stick on his hands and knees, Lasher wasn't
expecting to uncover much more than a charred piece of radio in the
burned-out remains of a B-17.
</p><p>
   Forty-nine years earlier, the warplane had carried four young
U.S. Army Air Force airmen to their deaths on the slopes of the San
Francisco Peaks near Flagstaff.
</p><p>
   When Lasher, an avid hiker and aviation history buff, spotted
the ring, he could scarcely believe his eyes.
</p><p>
   ``Mostly what I felt was, well, it was a very humbling moment,''
Lasher said. ``I was a kid during World War II, and I was in awe of
the guys who flew these planes and this ring belonged to one of
those young airman who was alive one minute and dead the next.''
</p><p>
   Now, Lasher, 60, a retired reproduction publishing manager for
AlliedSignal Engines, wants to track down any family or friends of
the ring's rightful owner.
</p><p>
   It's not as if Lasher doesn't know who the owner was.
</p><p>
   Through records provided by the Civil Air Patrol in Phoenix,
Lasher knew there had been a crash of a military aircraft at the
Flagstaff site in 1944.
</p><p>
   In fact, with all the World War II training facilities in and
around the Phoenix area, wreckage is reasonably common in the
mountains of Arizona.
</p><p>
   ``They catalog crashes as far back as 1940,'' Lasher said,
``giving brief descriptions of the aircraft, the location where it
crashed and when it happened. And in those days, the military
didn't go in and clean up the sites like they do today.''
</p><p>
   Starting seven years ago, Lasher began searching for the
wreckage. After three attempts over several years, he finally found
it.
</p><p>
   ``I knew a B-17 had crashed Sept. 17, 1944, near Bear Jaw Canyon
but it's so overgrown that you could walk right past an engine and
not even see it,'' he said.
</p><p>
   He also knew that the B-17, assigned to the Kingman Army Air
Field nearly 150 miles away, was on a night training flight. First
it was to visit Winslow, then Tucson and back to Kingman.
</p><p>
   On board was Lt. Richard V. Howell, 24, the pilot, from Chicago;
Lt. Richard A. Davis, 22, of Lincoln, Neb.; Flight Warrant Officer
Lafayette R. Brown, 21, of New London, Conn.; and Tech. Sgt. Edmund
M. Sikora, 26, also of Chicago.
</p><p>
   It was just at timberline where the bomber hit.
</p><p>
   ``Kind of a glancing blow,'' Lasher said. ``Another 100 feet
higher and they would have cleared the mountain. They came that
close.''
</p><p>
   After the plane hit, it broke apart, scattering debris over a
wide area.
</p><p>
   ``Three of the engines are still there on the ground,'' Lasher
said, ``and the fourth is three or four feet off the ground,
embedded in a tree.''
</p><p>
   Lasher said he returned to the crash site three or four times
after locating it and on his second visit, in August 1993, he found
the ring.
</p><p>
   With the help of a friend, Robert Kropp of Mesa, Lasher obtained
not only an Air Force report of the accident but a newspaper story
briefly recounting the crash:
</p><p>
   ``After passing over Flagstaff,'' the report said, ``the
aircraft made a 360 turn around the mountains located north of
Flagstaff. Shortly after, two fires broke out in the aircraft and a
minute later, another fire broke out at the rear of the aircraft.
The B-17 glided towards the earth. It hit the tops of trees at the
top of the peak, separating the tail assembly from the main part of
the airplane. The wreckage was completely burned. There were no
survivors.''
</p><p>
   On Sept. 23, 1944, The Arizona Republic reported: ``The bodies
of four airmen removed from a B-17 bomber, which crashed Monday
near the top of 12,000 foot San Francisco peaks, were brought out
of the wilderness to Kingman Army Airfield today.... A military
party reached the ship's burned wreckage last night.''
</p><p>
   Once Lasher unearthed the ring and wiped the years of soot and
dirt from it, the Cottonwood man found the USAAF's ``wings and
propeller'' insignia along with an eagle perched over sergeant's
chevrons.
</p><p>
   ``When I found out that this was an enlisted man's ring, I knew
who it belonged to,'' Lasher said. ``It had to be Edmund Sikora's,
the flight engineer or crew chief for that aircraft because he was
the only enlisted man aboard.''
</p><p>
   Checking further, Lasher discovered that young Sikora was
unmarried and had listed his mother, Josephine Sikora of Chicago as
his next of kin.
</p><p>
   Searching a phone book, Lasher has found nearly 30 listings with
the Sikora surname.
</p><p>
   And now with more time on his hands, because of his recent
retirement, he intends to contact them.
</p><p>
   ``If I can find a relative of his that's still living, and they
have an interest,'' Lasher said, ``I'd like to present the ring to
them.''
</p><p>
   For the moment, the silver ring rests in Lasher's jewelry box,
while a piece of the bomber's tail section sits in his yard.
</p><p>
   And if he fails to locate a suitable recipient in the next few
months, he'll loan the ring and the tailpiece to a new museum in
Kingman.
</p><p>
   ``At least that way,'' he said, ``a part of Edmund Sikora will
finally get back to where he was trying to go.''

FAMILIES SUE OVER AREOFLOT CRASH DEATHS
By PATRICIA YOUNG 
c.1996 South China Morning Post
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The Russian airline Aeroflot has been hit with a writ for loss
and damages, filed in Hong Kong by the families of seven passengers
killed in an air crash.
</p><p>
   All 75 people on board the Aeroflot Airbus died when it ploughed
into a Siberian mountain in March 1994.
</p><p>
   Aeroflot general manager for Hong Kong Vassili Tkatchenko said
on Tuesday he was unaware the writ had been filed.
</p><p>
   The writ is for ``damages, interest and costs'' of seven
passengers who died when the Moscow Airbus A310 flight bound for
Hong Kong crashed at Novokuznetsk, Siberia.
</p><p>
   It claims the deaths were ``caused by negligence, breach of
statutory duty and breach of contract on the part of the defendant
[Aeroflot].''
</p><p>
   Air industry investigators say the 15-year-old son of Captain
Yaroslav Kudrinsky was flying the Hong Kong-bound aircraft after it
left Moscow. Black box transcripts show Eldar and Yana, his
13-year-old sister, were in the cockpit prior to the crash.
</p><p>
   Airline passengers are protected under a section of the Warsaw
Convention relating to air travel which was signed on October 12,
1929.
</p><p>
   The liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to
passengers has an upper limit of US$75,000. But larger amounts have
been awarded through the courts or through out-of-court
settlements.
</p><p>
   Aviation consultant Steve Miller, the managing director of
Trinity Aviation, said he was unaware of any aviation court
settlements in Hong Kong.
</p><p>
   ``Taking it to the courts is very unusual for Hong Kong,'' Mr
Miller said.
</p><p>
   Six of the claims in the writs were filed by family members who
live outside Hong Kong.

4 KILLED AS PLANE HITS CAR IN MASS.
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By MATT BAI AND DAVID ARMSTRONG
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WAREHAM, Mass.  A;N;D;MD;  Four people, including a 4-year-old girl and
her mother, were killed Saturday when a single-engine airplane
trying to make an emergency landing touched down onto Interstate
495 and collided head-on with a station wagon, officials said.
</p><p>
   The two people in the plane, who were not identified, and the
two passengers in the car  A;N;D;MD;  Karen Wilkinson, 22, of Framingham and
her daughter, Brittany Karp  A;N;D;MD;  died in the fiery crash, officials
said. Wilkinson was taken by ambulance to Tobey Hospital in
Wareham, where she died a short time later, said Cynthia Outhouse,
a hospital spokeswoman.
</p><p>
   Her daughter apparently died at the scene of the accident, which
occurred at about 12:45 p.m.
</p><p>
   The driver of the car, 31-year-old Anthony Lobello of Wayland,
suffered head injuries and was evaluated at the hospital before
being airlifted to Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston late
Saturday afternoon. He was in stable condition.
</p><p>
   State Police said Saturday that they were still trying to
identify the pilot and passenger in the Piper Arrow plane, who
apparently died instantly when the aircraft exploded on impact.
</p><p>
   Lobello and Wilkinson were driving Brittany back to the Mashpee
home of her father, Edwin (Rusty) Karp, after spending the week
with her, Karp said Saturday. Brittany lived with her father, who
dated Wilkinson for three years, he said.
</p><p>
   ``This is the hardest day of my life,'' Karp said. ``Brittany
was the best little thing in the world. She was my life. I'm just
trying now to survive.''
</p><p>
   Of Wilkinson, a pharmacy technician at a CVS in Framingham, Karp
said, ``She loved Brittany very much. She had a great sense of
humor.''
</p><p>
   At about 12:45 p.m. the plane, apparently with the engine not
working, slashed a tree next to the highway, bounced on the
northbound lane and swerved across the median, officials said. The
plane hit the white Chevrolet station wagon as it traveled south.
</p><p>
   ``It was unbelievable  A;N;D;MD;  there were just flames and smoke
everywhere,'' said Eddie Caprarella, who was driving by.
</p><p>
   Joseph Monteiro, who lives near the crash site just over the
Middleborough town line, said he was washing his car when he heard
the falling plane hit the highway and saw it lurch left, right and
left again. Then there were two loud crashes and an explosion that
sent flames shooting as high as 80 feet into the air, he said.
</p><p>
   Monteiro said that Lobello got out of the car in a daze and was
pleading with other drivers to help Wilkinson, crying out: ``She's
choking! She's choking!''
</p><p>
   ``Definitely there was panic,'' Monteiro said. ``People on the
highway were just shocked.''
</p><p>
   Police and aviation authorities had not determined Saturday the
plane's point of origin or its intended destination. But a
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration at T.F. Green
State Airport in Warwick, R.I., said that the tower there had
received an emergency distress call from the plane saying that it
was having engine trouble.
</p><p>
   Controllers there tried to guide the plane to the nearest
airport, in New Bedford, but the pilot apparently attempted an
emergency landing either on the highway or in a bog next to it,
officials said.
</p><p>
   The plane was a 1973 model, said Merrill Cross, an investigator
on the scene from the Federal Aviation Administration. An
investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board was en
route from Washington Saturday, a spokesman from the FAA said.
</p><p>
   About a dozen grieving relatives of the victims arrived at Tobey
Hospital Saturday in shock.
</p><p>
   When Wilkinson's mother was told of the deaths of her daughter
and granddaughter by relatives outside the emergency room, she
collapsed instantly, wailing in agony.
</p><p>
   An aunt of Brittany's said, ``She was like a little flower that
was still blooming.''
</p><p>
   At the crash scene Saturday, where rescue crews continued the
grisly job of exploring the wreckage while traffic throughout the
region came to a halt, the twisted, burnt-out frame of the plane
lay stretched across Interstate 495. Only its wings, burnt to the
core, were recognizable.
</p><p>
   The station wagon, which had taken the most impact, was some 30
yards away, an empty baby seat in the front passenger side. A
child's bicycle appeared to have fallen out of the car and leaned
up against one side.
</p><p>
   State Trooper William Serpa, the first trooper to arrive on the
scene, said the carnage left rescue crews shaken. ``It was a very
traumatic experience,'' Serpa said. ``It wasn't something I'd want
to see every day.''
</p><p>
   Given the way in which the plane descended and swerved across a
major highway, it was amazing that more people were not hurt or
killed in the crash, State Police Lt. Ahmed Mustafa said.
</p><p>
   ``Maybe everyone was already down at the Cape,'' he said,
alluding to the light afternoon traffic on one of spring's first
balmy days. ``Or maybe it was just a fluke.''

<p>
   BOSTON  A;N;D;MD;  In era of corporate downsizing and labor-management
wars, Sam and Jim Snyder were the kind of bosses workers dream of.
</p><p>
   At the brothers' plastics firm in Rockland, Mass., all 85
employees worked full time, for full benefits, and a pay scale they
helped set themselves. Every worker  A;N;D;MD;  janitor or engineer,
machinist or manager  A;N;D;MD;  got business cards emblazoned with the
Polymer Design slogan: Together We Guarantee Success. And business
has boomed, through recessions and recoveries, up to $8 million in
annual sales.
</p><p>
   The Snyders' efforts in corporate responsibility came to a
disastrous end Saturday, when a single-engine plane they were
flying crash-landed into a station wagon on Route 495 in Wareham,
Mass.
</p><p>
   Samuel Snyder, 50, and James Snyder, 49, were killed, along with
a 4-year-old girl, Brittany Wilkinson-Karp, and her 23-year-old
mother, Karen Wilkinson.
</p><p>
   Investigators who examined the wreckage Sunday said they were
focusing on mechanical failure as the cause of the crash. They also
said it appears that Jim Snyder acted appropriately in trying to
emergency-land the plane, which was having engine trouble. A
preliminary report may be available from the National
Transportation Safety Board within several days, but a final report
is expected to take much longer.
</p><p>
   Meanwhile, families, friends and employees are left to take
stock in the wake of the sudden loss of four lives.
</p><p>
   The Snyders had worked together since 1979, when a coin toss
made Sam president and Jim vice president of their new firm. They
had grown up together, and socialized together. But though both
loved to fly, Saturday's ill-fated outing in a rented Piper Arrow
was the first time the brothers had flown together.
</p><p>
   ``They were a great team,'' said Jeffrey Esterman, a machinist
at Polymer Design for five years. ``They were always walking around
the factory, telling us how important we were to the company.
Everyone should have bosses like that.''
</p><p>
   Investigators believe Jim Snyder, of Newton, Mass., flew from
Norwood Memorial Airport to Plymouth Airport Saturday morning to
pick up Sam, a Hingham resident. The brothers then took off again,
headed to Block Island, off Rhode Island, investigators said.
</p><p>
   An air traffic control tower in Warwick, R.I., received the
Snyders' emergency distress call reporting engine trouble shortly
before 12:45 p.m. The tower tried to guide the aircraft, a 1973
model owned by ADS Flight Center, to the New Bedford airport.
</p><p>
   Minutes later, the plane bounced onto Route 495, swerved across
the median and crashed into a white Chevrolet Celebrity station
wagon heading south, about a mile south of Exit 2. The Snyders were
trying to make an emergency landing, either on the road or in a
nearby cranberry bog.
</p><p>
   The plane exploded on impact, killing the Snyders and little
Brittany instantly, officials said. Wilkinson, who worked at a CVS
in Framingham, died on the way to the hospital. Brittany was
supposed to attend a birthday party that afternoon.
</p><p>
   Officials at ADS Flight Center declined to comment Sunday.
</p><p>
   The only survivor of the crash was Anthony Lobello, the driver
of the station wagon. Lobello, 31, of Wayland, an unemployed auto
mechanic who had dated Wilkinson for several years, was in stable
condition Sunday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
</p><p>
   ``He has no broken bones, only a broken heart,'' said his
mother, Marie Lobello. ``He feels like he should be dead, too. He
keeps saying, `They're dead, I should be dead.' ''
</p><p>
   Lobello told his family the plane swooped into his path out of
nowhere, giving him no chance to swerve out of the way. Witnesses
said the plane's engine appeared to be stalled and that its
propeller had stopped spinning.
</p><p>
   ``It was too quick, too fast  A;N;D;MD;  there was nothing he could do,''
Marie Lobello said. ``He heard people screaming that they were on
fire, but he couldn't do anything. It was all in flames, it was
just too quick.''
</p><p>
   Friends and neighbors of the Snyders, who both were married with
children, said the brothers were avid and reliable pilots. They
said that Sam had considered a career in aviation, and that Jim
also knew what he was doing.
</p><p>
   ``He loved flying, and he was very good at it,'' said Andrew
Melton, Jim Snyder's neighbor in Newton.
</p><p>
   For the Snyders, the fiery explosion ended a remarkable
entrepreneurial success story. Both were trained as engineers  A;N;D;MD;  Sam
at the US Naval Academy and Columbia, Jim at Northeastern
University  A;N;D;MD;  but found their calling in the business world,
parlaying their technical knowledge about liquid resins into an
international moneymaker.
</p><p>
   Over 17 years, Polymer Design Corp. carved a niche as a reliable
source for small but complex orders of custom-made plastic parts.
It supplies medical firms with arthro-scopes, heart pumps and
high-tech devices for spinal surgery. It makes protective suits for
helicopter crews and bomb disposal squads. It once replicated a
1950s Cadillac tail fin for a customer.
</p><p>
   With Sam Snyder overseeing the engineers and Jim Snyder in
charge of sales and administration, the firm has earned a
reputation as a pioneer in its field. It has grown almost every
year, and added 13,000 square feet of factory space at the start of
this decade.
</p><p>
   But the Pleasant Street company is also known as a solid
corporate citizen. In 1994, the Snyders donated a used machine-shop
lathe to the Rockland High School shop department, saving the
cash-strapped school an estimated $30,000.
</p><p>
   ``They were really unique,'' said David Salto, an engineer at
Polymer Design. ``I'll tell you, they always listened to what we
had to say, even if we disagreed with them. They always treated all
of us with respect. I just can't say enough about them.''
</p><p>
   Polymer Design is a private firm, but the Snyders regularly
opened their books to their employees. They also invited workers to
suggest pay structures that would reward teamwork and customer
service. And they often footed the bill for company outings, trying
to foster a sense of camaraderie and pride.
</p><p>
   There is no union at Polymer Design, but every employee works
full-time, with health insurance and a 401K plan. Workers say it is
no accident that most of them have stayed with the company for
years.
</p><p>
   ``People just don't leave,'' Esterman said. ``Jim and Sam were
tough businessmen, but they made sure we were all happy.''
</p><p>
   Sam Snyder leaves his wife, a Marshfield, Mass., schoolteacher,
and three children. Jim Snyder leaves his wife and two children.
</p><p>
   Meanwhile, Rusty Karp was preparing Sunday to bury his daughter
Brittany next to her mother. The girl spent last week at
Wilkinson's home in Framingham, and was to have returned home
Friday night to Karp's home on the Cape, where she has lived for
the past three years. But Brittany had been ill, so Karp agreed to
let Wilkinson bring her back Saturday, as long as she returned in
time for a friend's birthday party.
</p><p>
   ``His whole life is dwindling,'' said Karp's sister, Mary Jane
Dyer. ``She was the center of his life, she was his everything.''
</p><p>
   A funeral will be held for Karen Wilkinson and Brittany
Wilkinson-Karp on Wednesday. James Snyder's funeral will be held
Tuesday. Funeral arrangements for Samuel Snyder were incomplete.

TWO PRIOR CRASHES OF 737S STILL UNSOLVED
(With CRASH-BROWN-NYT)
(HLW)
By MATTHEW L. WALD
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  The Air Force plane that crashed in Croatia on
Wednesday was a modified version of the Boeing 737, a widely used
aircraft with one of the best safety records in the air. But two
unexplained crashes in the last five years, in Pittsburgh and
Colorado Springs, have raised questions about the 737's
performance.
</p><p>
   Like the plane that crashed on Wednesday, those aircraft crashed
while approaching airports for landing. But it is not known if
there are any similarities between the crashes in the United States
and the crash in Croatia.
</p><p>
   The investigators in the crash on Wednesday may be lacking one
basic tool available to those probing the civilian crashes. The Air
Force public affairs office at the Pentagon said that the plane,
like many of its aircraft, did not carry a cockpit voice recorder
or a flight data recorder, which are commonly known as black boxes.
However, a spokesman for the U.S. European Command, in Stuttgart,
Germany, contradicted that, saying such equipment was aboard.
</p><p>
   The Pittsburgh crash, of a USAir flight from Chicago that
crashed on an airport approach in 1994, is the most intensively
studied crash in the history of American civil aviation, but safety
experts still do not know what caused it. The Colorado Springs
crash, in 1991, is also unexplained; transportation officials hope
the investigation of the Pittsburgh crash will help explain it.
</p><p>
   The 737 is the single most popular commercial jet, and it makes
up about a quarter of the American airline jet fleet. Boeing has
sold over 1,100 of the 737-200s, the model that crashed on
Wednesday, and over 2,800 of all types of 737s, with 500 more on
order.
</p><p>
   The Air Force bought 19, including the one that crashed on
Wednesday, for $5.4 million each, and they were delivered in 1973
and 1974. Most are used for training navigators. Until Wednesday,
the Air Force had never had a crash involving the planes, or indeed
any incident that resulted in a death or permanent disability.
</p><p>
   The plane that crashed had recorded 12,000 landings and 17,000
hours of flight, which made it a relatively young aircraft, said
Maj. Laura J. Feldman, a spokesman for the Air Force. The plane was
flying from Tuzla to Dubrovnik, a 45-minute trip.
</p><p>
   Among the characteristics that make the 737 desirable for the
Air Force is its ability to operate from short, rough airfields.
</p><p>
   The plane that crashed, called a T-43 by the Air Force, was set
up to carry about 60 passengers. It had fewer windows than the
airline model and some extra electronic equipment protruding from
its stubby, 100-foot-long body.
</p><p>
   The plane had been used in Bosnia in recent weeks to ferry
American and NATO dignitaries to and from airports where many
runways have been scarred by civil war. Air Force officials say
that Secretary of State Warren Christopher flew aboard the plane
during a visit to the Balkans earlier this year.
</p><p>
   The plane had been used earlier this week to ferry Defense
Secretary William Perry on trips within the Balkans  A;N;D;MD;  from Zagreb,
the Croatian capital, to Tuzla and Sarajevo in Bosnia, and then to
Tirana, Albania, and from Albania to Cairo on Tuesday. Military
officials said that the plane then returned to Zagreb to pick up
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and his delegation.
</p><p>
   For security, the crew minimized time at low altitudes, to limit
the possibility of the plane being hit by gunfire or shells fired
by rebel forces, according to officials.
</p><p>
   The plane, clearly marked with a U.S. flag on its tail and the
bold lettering ``United States of America'' on its side, was based
at Ramstein Air Base, in Germany, as was its crew. The civilian
version has a crew of three; the Air Force said that the plane that
crashed had six crewmen on board.
</p><p>
   Investigators working on the Pittsburgh crash say they believe
that the aircraft's trajectory on Wednesday can be explained only
by a sudden, full swing of the rudder on its tail, but the parts
that survived the wreckage do not provide any physical evidence
that this actually occurred, and the flight data recorder was not
sophisticated enough to record the information.
</p><p>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, the independent
federal agency in charge of investigating civilian aircraft
accidents, hopes to finish the investigation and reach a conclusion
this year.
</p><p>
   Apart from Colorado Springs and Pittsburgh, the agency has only
three unsolved crashes in its 29-year history.
</p><p>
   The Safety Board is sending several investigators with the
military team to look into the crash.

PLANE'S CRASH AGAIN RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS CIVILIAN COUSIN, THE
737
(For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
(With BROWN-CRASH)
By T.M. SELL
c.1996 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The jet that crashed Wednesday with U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown and 32 others aboard was a military derivative of the Boeing
737  A;N;D;MD;  similar in many ways to the civilian model but different in
that it had no in-flight voice or data recorders.
</p><p>
   Boeing sold 19 of the T-43 models to the U.S. government in
1973-74 for use as trainers. A couple, like the one that crashed
Wednesday, were later refitted to carry passengers.
</p><p>
   The T-43 is basically a 737-200 model with a reinforced floor to
support training equipment and with fewer windows. Most of the
fleet is involved in training flight navigators for other U.S.
military aircraft, stationed at Air Force bases around the United
States. The plane that crashed was stationed at Ramstein Air Force
Base in Germany as part of the 76th Airlift Squadron.
</p><p>
   The tragedy again raises questions about the 737, if only
because the well-traveled jetliner has been involved in a pair of
unsolved crashes in recent years. A March 3, 1991, crash of a
United Airlines 737 near Colorado Springs killed 25 people. The
Sept. 8, 1994, crash of a USAir 737 near Alequippa, Pa., in which
132 people died, remains under investigation.
</p><p>
   In both accidents, the aircraft rolled sharply and crashed.
Federal investigations into the crashes have centered on
unexplained movements of the rudder. About a dozen such incidents,
not involving crashes, have been recorded on 737 flights.
</p><p>
   U.S. Air Force and Boeing representatives said they have no
immediate explanations for Wednesday's crash in the coastal
mountains of Croatia. The 22-year-old aircraft had modern safety
equipment and was certified for instrument flying in the type of
stormy weather reported in the area at the time of the crash.
</p><p>
   Boeing spokesman Russ Young said the company will send experts
to support the Air Force's investigation of the crash.
</p><p>
   That investigation will be hampered by the T-43's lack of the
``black box'' recorders that are standard equipment on commercial
jets. Air Force Maj. Felicity Tavares said the T-43 was equipped
only with a ground-proximity warning system and standard commercial
navigational aids.
</p><p>
   The airplane had logged about 17,000 hours of flying time and
had 12,000 take-off and landing cycles. Boeing officials say that's
not much by normal commercial standards, and especially not for a
737, which is designed for frequent, short-haul service.
</p><p>
   Aerospace industry officials say the crash underscores the
challenge facing modern aviation, to reduce the number of crashes
even as the number of flights increases.
</p><p>
   The challenge is particularly acute for the 737. With more than
2,600 jets in service and more than 3,300 ordered, the 737 is the
world's best-selling jetliner. Boeing executives and many observers
argue that, considering its tremendous number of flights in all
conditions, the 737 is as safe as any aircraft.
</p><p>
   Tim Neale of the Air Transport Association, which represents
U.S. airlines, said that the incidence of accidents has fallen by
half over the past 15 years. But the rising number of flights makes
it sometimes appear that the chance of a crash is increasing.
</p><p>
   From 1979 to 1994, the number of fatal accidents was 1 per 1.8
million flights, Neale said, vs. 1 per 814,000 flights from 1963 to
1978.
</p><p>
   Bob Robeson, vice president of civil aviation for the Aerospace
Industries Association, a manufacturers' group, said the
improvements have flowed from advancements in technology as well as
training.
</p><p>
   ``Controlled flight into terrain'' was a leading cause of
crashes until the advent of the ground-proximity warning system,
which tells pilots when they're too close to the ground, Robeson
said.
</p><p>
   ``Human factors''  A;N;D;MD;  such as improved training, improved
flight-deck design and improved maintenance  A;N;D;MD;  also have played a
large role in improving safety, he said.
</p><p>
   Still, the severity of air crashes, no matter how rare, makes
the safety issue one of constant concern. Industry officials
acknowledge that if the public doesn't think it's safe to fly,
they'll be out of business.

TRADE MISSION TURNS TRAGIC
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By PAUL QUINN-JUDGE
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown and 32 others
are missing and believed dead after a US Air Force jetliner
carrying them from the Bosnian city of Tuzla to the Croatian port
of Dubrovnik crashed in bad weather Wednesday.
</p><p>
   The plane hit a hillside 1.8 miles from Dubrovnik airport as it
prepared to land in poor visibility, Lt. Gen. Howell M. Estes of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Wednesday. Croatian special police
had made their way up to the remote, cloud-covered site, Estes
said, and US troops were on the way.
</p><p>
   Unconfirmed reports from Dubrovnik included accounts of rescue
teams finding several bodies and one person, a woman, alive. The
woman was later reported to have died of her injuries on the way to
a local hospital. ``We have no confirmed reports of either
fatalities or survivors,'' Estes said, although officials said they
were pessimistic.
</p><p>
   Brown would be the first serving Cabinet officer to die in the
line of duty in more than 150 years. The plane was also carrying a
delegation of senior American business executives.
</p><p>
   Officials in Washington appeared inclined to blame the weather
for the crash. They said there was no indication of hostile fire or
a suspicious explosion.
</p><p>
   Brown was ``one of the best advisers and ablest people I ever
knew,'' President Clinton told staff at the Commerce Department
Wednesday afternoon when it became clear that little hope remained
of finding any survivors.
</p><p>
   A consummate Washington insider and former staff director for
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, Brown had been chairman of the Democratic
Party before becoming Commerce secretary in 1993.
</p><p>
   He was traveling in the Balkans with senior executives from US
corporations in an effort to involve US business in the Balkans,
and particularly in the postwar reconstruction of Bosnia. Earlier
in the day, he had spent time with US troops in Tuzla, regaling
them with Big Macs and tapes of the NCAA basketball finals.
</p><p>
   Other passengers on the plane are thought to include members of
Brown's staff, senior officials of the Commerce and Energy
departments, and Nathaniel Nash, a correspondent from the New York
Times. Six of the missing are believed to have been the Air Force
crew members of the T-43 aircraft, the military version of a Boeing
737.
</p><p>
   Wednesday afternoon, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton visited Brown's wife, Alma, and son Michael, for 50 minutes
at the Browns' Washington townhouse. Brown's daughter, Tracey, was
flying in from California.
</p><p>
   After the visit, the Clintons and members of the Cabinet went to
the Commerce Department. Clinton addressed staff members, many of
whom wept.
</p><p>
   ``We do not know for sure what happened there,'' Clinton said,
referring to the crash. But he paid tribute to Brown, describing
him as ``a magnificent life force.''
</p><p>
   ``He was one of the best advisers and ablest people I ever knew.
And he was very, very good at everything he ever did. Whether he
was commerce secretary or a civil rights leader or something else,
he was always out there just giving it his all,'' he said.
</p><p>
   ``This is a man whose multiple talents will not be easily
replaced,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's
delegate to Congress. ``For the African-American community, the
loss is into infinity.''
</p><p>
   After visiting the Brown home Wednesday afternoon, Kennedy
issued a statement saying, ``At a time of increasing polarization
and heightened voices and more intense rhetoric, Ron cut to the
core of an issue and was able to reconcile different viewpoints in
a way that established common ground. We need those talents much
more as a country.''
</p><p>
   Fears for the plane began to surface in Washington late
Wednesday morning. Well over three hours after the plane had been
due to land, the White House put out a terse statement saying that
it was missing. By then, night was beginning to fall in Croatia.
</p><p>
   For a number of hours, the fact that the plane was missing was
the only confirmed piece of information. Confusion reigned, with US
and Croatian officials offering differing locations for the crash
site.
</p><p>
   US officials spoke of wreckage being seen in the Adriatic Sea
off Dubrovnik, while Croatian officials, including President Franjo
Tudjman, said the plane had crashed into a mountainside near the
Dubrovnik airport.
</p><p>
   Planes and helicopters searched the Adriatic for signs of a
crash. But the Croatians, whose troops were scouring the mountains
around the airport, proved to be right. Later in the day, Estes of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff pieced together the chronology of the
tragedy at a press briefing in the Pentagon.
</p><p>
   Brown's plane had left Tuzla, the northern Bosnian city that is
the headquarters of US military operations in the country, around 2
p.m. local time (7 a.m. EST). The flight should have taken about 45
minutes.
</p><p>
   Because of bad weather around Dubrovnik, the pilots used an
instrument approach, a standard procedure in poor weather, Estes
said. The plane was in contact with the control tower in Dubrovnik
when communications were suddenly lost at 2:52 p.m. Croatian time.
</p><p>
   The plane crashed into the top of St John's Hill, a 2,300-foot
hill about 1.8 miles northwest of the airport, he said. Officials
noted that the crash site put the plane well off course.
</p><p>
   The T-43, based in Ramstein, Germany, had been used to transport
a number of VIPs around the region, officials said, including
Defense Secretary Willian Perry and Hillary Clinton and the
Clintons' daughter, Chelsea. It had undergone a ``total''
maintenance and inspection in June 1995 and run up a total of about
17,000 flying hours, a relatively modest amount, he said.
</p><p>
   Bad weather had not hindered other planes landing at Dubrovnik
airport Wednesday: Tudjman told CNN that three aircraft  A;N;D;MD;  two
Croatian and one Swiss  A;N;D;MD;  had landed there ``half an hour'' before
Brown's plane was due to arrive.
</p><p>
    A;N;D;UR; el.5l A;N;D;LR; 
</p><p>
   But conditions remained so bad that a US military helicopter was
unable to land near the crash site and had to return to the
airport.
</p><p>
   The US Air Force appointed Brig. Gen. Charles Coolidge to lead
an inquiry into the crash. Coolidge was to leave for Dubrovnik last
night, and will be assisted by members of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</p><p>
   Officials said the plane lacked a flight recorder, which might
have helped determine the cause of the crash.
</p><p>
   Investigators will almost certainly be able to use less
conventional sources of information. These could include AWACS, or
airborne warning and control systems, aircraft and the National
Security Agency, the secretive communications intelligence
organization that is reported to be very active in monitoring the
Balkans peace process.

BODY OF BROWN AMONG 33 RECOVERED
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By PAUL QUINN-JUDGE
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  Working in foul weather and hampered by the hazard
of mines, search parties on Saint John's Hill just outside
Dubrovnik, Croatia, recovered the remains of 33 people Thursday
from the wreckage of a US Air Force jet. Among them was the body of
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown.
</p><p>
   Brown and his colleagues died on Wednesday when their plane,
flying in heavy rain and near-zero visibility, apparently went off
course and crashed into the hillside, nearly 2 miles northwest of
Dubrovnik airport. Brown was flying to the Croatian port city for
talks with government ministers after visiting US troops in the
northern Bosnian city of Tuzla.
</p><p>
   As investigators arrived to search for the causes of the
accident and military mortuary teams started work, confusion
remained on a number of key issues. Why was the plane off course?
Were there 33 people on board or 35, as a manifest released by the
State Department indicated? Did the plane have a voice recorder and
so-called black box and if not, why not?
</p><p>
   Two things were clear, US Ambassador to Croatia Peter Galbraith
said Thursday in Dubrovnik after he visited the crash site. One was
that the weather was terrible: ``In fact, people in Dubrovnik said
this is the worst storm in a decade.''
</p><p>
   The other was that the plane ``was not where is should have
been.'' Instead of approaching the airport from the sea, it was
flying up a valley ``one ridge over'' from the airport, he said.
</p><p>
   Officials do, however, seem to be increasingly confident that
the plane was not attacked by renegade soldiers from any of the
armies operating in the region.
</p><p>
   While the area had once been on the front lines in the war
between Croat and Serb armies, Defense Secretary William Perry said
Thursday that potentially hostile forces were no longer in the
area. And, he added, ``you cannot direct ground fire against an
airplane if you can't see it.'' Visibility in the area was so bad
at the time of the crash, he said, that ``directing small arms fire
or directing a shoulder-fired rocket at the airplane would have
been almost impossible.''
</p><p>
   But, Perry added, it would take ``some days'' for investigators
to determine exactly what happened. Officials have declined to
speculate about the causes of the crash. But a Defense Department
official said Thursday, ``The most likely hypotheses are serious
pilot error or serious equipment malfunction.''
</p><p>
   In Washington, meanwhile, President Clinton ordered all flags on
official buildings to be flown at half-staff until April 10. After
a private memorial service at St John's Church in Washington, a
short distance from the White House, Clinton once again paid
tribute to Brown, his government colleagues, the business
executives and others who died with him.
</p><p>
   Clinton's spokesman, Michael McCurry, described the president as
``in a very somber mood.''
</p><p>
   No date has yet been announced either for a funeral or for the
return of the bodies. Brown's family was to gather Thursday to
discuss the funeral arrangements, McCurry said.
</p><p>
   Earlier Thursday morning, the White House said, Clinton broke
the news to Alma Brown that her husband's body had been identified
by Brig. Gen. Andrew Canavan, the senior US military officer on the
scene.
</p><p>
   Perry, reflecting on the death of Brown and of Deputy Assistant
Defense Secretary Joseph Kruzel  A;N;D;MD;  killed in an accident outside
Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, in August  A;N;D;MD;  said the tragedies
illustrated the risks involved in operations such as the one in
Bosnia.
</p><p>
   But, he told journalists, ``I believe our security interests are
worth risks.'' Perry noted that he had in fact flown to Egypt in
the same plane the day before it returned to Europe to collect
Brown.
</p><p>
   By late Thursday, remains of 14 people had been removed from the
crash site and taken to Dubrovnik, the Defense Department said.
</p><p>
   An internal government memo described the scene at the crash
site. The memo said that the aircraft, a Boeing-made T-43, was
lying in pieces, with fragments spread over a radius of 400 meters.
The plane showed some signs of fire, but there were no indications
that it had been struck by a projectile. The bodies were thrown
clear of the plane.
</p><p>
   Heavy rain, high winds, fog and wind chills in the low 30s
continued to make the retrieval work difficult. The bad weather, in
fact, seems to have played a role in diverting investigators flying
from the United States to Vicenza in Italy. A US mortuary team has
arrived at the scene, and additional staff is on its way from Fort
Lee in Virginia.
</p><p>
   Croatian officials at the site continued to insist that black
boxes  A;N;D;MD;  voice and data recorders built to withstand a crash and
help explain its causes  A;N;D;MD;  had been found at the site.
</p><p>
   Estes disputed this. ``The information we have is that this
aircraft was not equipped with what you would consider black
boxes,'' he said. Searchers may have recovered instruments in black
boxes, he said. But real black boxes are in fact colored bright
orange, to facilitate their retrieval.
</p><p>
   The T-43 is the military equivalent of the Boeing 737. Most of
the 19 purchased by the Air Force have been used to train aviators
in navigation.
</p><p>
   Estes attributed the lack of a black box to the fact that the
plane had been acquired originally as a training aircraft.

NEW PRESSURES ON AIRLINE CRASH-LIABILITY ACCORD
(lh)
By MATTHEW L. WALD
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  The Warsaw Convention governing the liability of an
airline when passengers die in a plane crash is crumbling as
airlines try to raise the accord's $75,000 limit on damages.
</p><p>
   But prospects for a new agreement are uncertain, because the
U.S. Department of Transportation is demanding that the accord
provide that damage suits involving Americans be heard in the
United States. Some foreign airlines reject that demand.
</p><p>
   This is the third effort to raise the $75,000 limit, which was
set in 1966 and which all parties agree is now far too low. Efforts
in 1977 and 1988 would have raised the limit several-fold and were
eagerly supported by U.S. officials, but the United States did not
approve them. Trial lawyers said the higher limits were still too
low, and aircraft manufacturers feared high limits would encourage
suits against them.
</p><p>
   ``The amount of time it's taking to do something rational is
simply astonishing,'' said Jeffrey N. Shane, an aviation lawyer who
was assistant secretary of transportation for policy and
international affairs from 1989 to 1993.
</p><p>
   The Warsaw Convention, initiated in 1929 among 29 countries and
joined by the United States in 1934, also governs who may sue and
where, and details cargo rules. All nations with commercial
airlines have signed on, but the airlines agree that the document
needs to be updated.
</p><p>
   Because of the low liability limit, many airlines are
voluntarily paying more, either to spare themselves a lengthy trial
at which families will try to show negligence  A;N;D;MD;  which allows higher
damages  A;N;D;MD;  or for general good will, or because they do not think
the limits will hold up in court.
</p><p>
   American Airlines, for example, has told families of the people
who died when one of its planes crashed in Colombia in December
that it would negotiate as if the limit did not exist; it is doing
the same for the 16 passengers on international trips who were on
the American Eagle commuter flight that crashed in Roselawn, Ind.,
in October 1994.
</p><p>
   ``The message American is sending is, `We'll do what's fair,
because we know a jury will do what's fairer,''' said Barry Lambert
Harris, who was an acting administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration in the Bush administration.
</p><p>
   But the airlines would like a realistic limit and uniform
system. Representatives of airlines from around the world met this
week in Montreal to try to work out the details of a system with no
limits. U.S. airlines have received an antitrust exemption to
negotiate an agreement, which would be subject to government
approval.
</p><p>
   The airlines and U.S. officials envision fairly simple
negotiations with families over ``economic damages,'' the amount
that the victim was likely to have earned over the remaining years
of his or her life, given normal life expectancy. The sticking
point now is which court would resolve disputes if negotiations
failed.
</p><p>
   Under the current agreement, survivors can bring suit in the
country the plane was flying to, the home country of the airline, a
country where the airline has its major operation or the country
where the contract for transportation was written.
</p><p>
   The United States wants a ``fifth jurisdiction'' for Americans:
the United States. Since domestic carriers are based here, they can
already be sued here; adding the ``fifth jurisdiction'' would
generally affect overseas carriers.

SOMBER FAREWELL IN CROATIA FOR U.S. VICTIMS
(th)
By CHRIS HEDGES
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   DUBROVNIK, Croatia  A;N;D;MD;  The coffins carrying the remains of
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and 32 other Americans killed in a
plane crash Wednesday were loaded onto two C-17 transport planes
that took off for Dover Air Force Base in Delaware after a somber
farewell ceremony in Dubrovnik on Saturday morning.
</p><p>
   Croatian and American officials, flanked by 19 American and 19
Croatian honor guards, stood as the last four coffins, two covered
with the American flag and two with the Croatian flag, were laid on
the tarmac. Two of those who died in the crash were Croatian
citizens.
</p><p>
   President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, who spoke at the ceremony,
said his nation was ``shaken by pain and sorrow.''
</p><p>
   ``Today when we take our leave from Ron Brown and all other
senior U.S. officials, on behalf of the whole of Croatia and
myself, I express my deepest sympathy to the families of those who
have perished,'' Tudjman said. ``You will remain forever in our
memory.''
</p><p>
   He posthumously awarded Brown a high Croatian decoration.
</p><p>
   In a brief euology, the American ambassador to Croatia, Peter W.
Galbraith, reminded those present that Saturday was Easter eve.
</p><p>
   ``As Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount,'' the ambassador
said, ``blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the
children of God. Blessed indeed are our friends and colleagues who
perished on a mission of peace.''
</p><p>
   The Air Force T-43 plane slammed into a rocky hill named after
St. John the Baptist on Wednesday in heavy rain and fog. The 35
passengers on board were killed, most instantly.
</p><p>
   The two Croatians and Brown are the only victims whose bodies
have been identified. The remaining bodies, many badly burned or
mutilated, will be identified by forensic experts in the United
States.
</p><p>
   Galbraith said the most fitting memorial would be to make peace
``a reality on the ground'' and to offer ``a vastly better future
to people who in the last five years have suffered so much.''
</p><p>
   He called on Americans, Croats and Bosnians to build the
``decent, honorable and wonderfully ordinary lives that we
Americans too often take for granted.''
</p><p>
   The Roman Catholic archbishop of Dubrovnik, Zelimir Puljic, said
a prayer and blessed the remains. A bugler played taps before the
planes taxied to the runway and lifted off in a clear sky for the
11-hour journey.
</p><p>
   American investigators continued to search the crash site
Saturday and had cordoned off a debris-covered area with orange
tape and also marked several pieces of wreckage with tape. The
investigating team that will try to determine the causes of the
accident arrived in Dubrovnik on Saturday.
</p><p>
   The white tail section of the plane, with the Stars and Stripes
visible, and a few rows of attached passenger seats are the only
large pieces left. A long black burn mark outlined where the body
of the aircraft probably had been. Down the steep, rocky hillside
lay part of the engine and a chunk of the fuselage.

TWO DIE IN HELO CRASH OFF CHINA 
c.1996 South China Morning Post
By JONATHAN HILL and ADAM LEE in Macau Two Chinese crew members
were killed Tuesday when their helicopter crashed near Macau.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The China Southern Helicopter Company aircraft was on its way to
Zhuhai, apparently returning from an oil rig, when it crashed, said
a spokesman for Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department.
</p><p>
   Other reports said the helicopter, which went down 10 to 15
nautical miles southeast of the Portuguese enclave, was gathering
weather information.
</p><p>
   The incident fell within Hong Kong airspace, triggering a search
by Civil Aviation Department rescuers.
</p><p>
   Two Government Flying Service helicopters joined Macau Marine
Police in the search for the Sikorsky 76.
</p><p>
   Mainland authorities later told the department's Aeronautical
Rescue Co-ordination Centre the wreckage had been recovered from
the Chinese island of Daiwaishan.
</p><p>
   ``Someone on the island heard a noise and called Zhuhai airport
authorities,'' said a Macau aviation source. ``China sent a
helicopter and confirmed the crash on the island.''
</p><p>
   Macau authorities, who lost radar contact at 10 am, said the
pilots had been found at the site ``and appeared dead''.
</p><p>
   Zhuhai officials confirmed the crew had been killed.
</p><p>
   Sources suggested that poor weather was the likely cause of the
crash.
</p><p>
   The Royal Observatory reported strong winds in the area at the
time. Rescuers also reported poor visibility.
</p><p>
   China, as the country of registration, would investigate the
incident, the Civil Aviation Department said.

GIRL, FATHER, INSTRUCTOR KILLED IN PLANE CRASH
(For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
By LARRY D. HATFIELD and ERIN McCORMICK
c.1996 San Francisco Examiner
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  A;N;D;MD;  A 7-year-old Pescadero, Calif., girl's dream of
making history by flying coast-to-coast in both directions ended in
tragedy Thursday morning when her light plane crashed in a
Cheyenne, Wyo., rain, hail and snowstorm, killing her, her father
and her flight instructor.
</p><p>
   Jessica Dubroff, her father, Lloyd Dubroff, 57, a San Mateo,
Calif., corporate consultant, and her flight instructor and
co-pilot, Joe Reid, 52, all perished when the four-seat Cessna
Skyhawk went down in a residential neighborhood seconds after it's
7:24 PDT takeoff in heavy rain, mixed with light hail and snow.
</p><p>
   ``We don't have any details except we are not expecting any
patients,'' said Ginger Humphrey, a spokeswoman for United Medical
Center.
</p><p>
   Witness Tom Johnson, a pilot, said it appeared the pilot was
trying to return to the airport in the face of the rapidly
developing storm when ``it stalled over my building, winged over
and went straight into the ground like a dart.''
</p><p>
   ``I kept thinking, `Please, please get some altitude,''' Johnson
said, saying the plane never got more than 400 feet off the ground.
``It just went right into the ground. I knew no one survived. It
would have been impossible.''
</p><p>
   It was not immediately known who was at the controls, said
Cheyenne police spokesman Dick Royce. But the ground rules for the
record attempt were that Reid was to touch the controls only in an
emergency and Dubroff was to ride in the back seat.
</p><p>
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mitch Barker in
Seattle said the small plane crashed about a mile north of the
airport after taking off to the west.
</p><p>
   ``It went in nose first,'' said Dawn Salyards, a resident of the
area. ``From the looks of it you could tell, pretty much right
away, that there would be no survivors.''
</p><p>
   It barely missed one house, landing at the end of the driveway,
witnesses said. Debris was scattered throughout the neighborhood in
this quiet prairie city of about 50,000. The FAA and police said
fuel spilled but there was no fire.
</p><p>
   Within 20 minutes of the crash, a tarp had been placed over the
plane. The only sections visible were the tail and wings, which
were crumpled.
</p><p>
   Mike Benson, spokesman for the National Transportation Safety
Board, which investigates 2,000 plane crashes a year, said a team
was enroute from Seattle to probe the crash.
</p><p>
   ``We will be looking at all aspects of the accident, from the
human factors to the mechanical,'' he said.
</p><p>
   Certain to be a focus of the investigation was the stunt itself,
the type of flight  A;N;D;MD;  and pilot  A;N;D;MD;  many air safety experts say should
be discouraged.
</p><p>
   ``The Guinness Book of Records'' had ceased recognizing the
``youngest pilot'' category for fear of encouraging unsafe flights.
</p><p>
   The FAA's Barker, would not comment on the potential danger of
such record-breaking attempts. ``The FAA was aware that there was a
record attempt being made by the 7-year-old,'' he said. ``This is
not the first time something like this has been attempted by
minors.
</p><p>
   ``The FAA's position is that the flight instructor is in
control. The 7-year-old was considered a passenger (and) was not
considered to be in control of the plane.''
</p><p>
   The minimum age for a pilot's license is 16.
</p><p>
   Before the flight, Jessica's father said the girl ``dragged her
mother and me into this'' and was not pushed by parental ambition.
</p><p>
   ``If she can do this, she can do anything,'' he said. ``And it
will expand her horizons. She's going see the country slide by
under her wing at 150 knots ... and she's going to be able to say,
`I did that.'''
</p><p>
   A man who answered the Reid home telephone in Half Moon Bay,
Calif., shortly after the crash, said, ``I'm sorry, we're not
making any comments right now.''
</p><p>
   The Dubroff home telephone was not answered.

7-YEAR-OLD TRYING FOR PILOTING RECORD DIES IN CRASH
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By ADAM PERTMAN AND JANE MEREDITH ADAMS
c.1996 The Boston Globe
    A 7-year-old girl, pursuing her dream of becoming the
youngest pilot to crisscross America, died Thursday when her plane
plummeted at the start of her journey's second leg.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Jessica Dubroff's body was found in the wreckage near the
municipal airport in Cheyenne, Wyo. Her father, Lloyd, and her
flight instructor, Joe Reid, also died in the crash.
</p><p>
   The three left an airfield outside Pescadero, Calif. Wednesday,
spent the night in Cheyenne and planned to conclude their trip by
meeting the young girl's mother in Falmouth, Mass.
</p><p>
   The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators to
the scene of the crash, and the Federal Aviation Administration
said it would review its rules governing who may operate an
aircraft. The minimum age for taking a plane's controls alone is
16, but there's no restriction on anyone doing so alongside a
willing licensed pilot.
</p><p>
   ``I fly for joy. I'm going to fly till I fly solo. I'm going to
fly until I die,'' Jessica said before leaving here Wednesday. As
she climbed into her Cessna 177B in Wyoming Thursday, she expressed
just one fear: ``crashing.'' But she went on to say she did not
worry about it.
</p><p>
   At 4-foot-2, Jessica was too short to reach the plane's pedals,
so they were equipped with extenders for her. The craft had two
sets of controls, so Reid could take over  A;N;D;MD;  as he did over the
Rocky Mountains on the way to Wyoming  A;N;D;MD;  whenever he deemed it
necessary.
</p><p>
   Authorities said they were unsure who was guiding the plane when
it went down in driving rain and snow Thursday morning, minutes
after attaining a height of only a few hundred feet. A witness, Tom
Johnson, said he saw the Cessna stall over the building where he
worked and then nose-dive ``like a dart'' before smashing into the
ground near a driveway and scores of houses and cars.
</p><p>
   Why Reid allowed the flight to take place Thursday is a mystery.
Asked about his pending trip before leaving Pescadero, he replied:
``Basically the only ground rule is good weather. ... If there's
any weather ahead of us that doesn't look good, we're either going
to wait it out or go around it.''
</p><p>
   The girl's parents, who did not live together, sought to give
her an untraditional upbringing. Her mother, Lisa Blair Hathaway,
taught Jessica and her two other young children at home. Lloyd
Dubroff tried to provide what he described as a ``real world''
education  A;N;D;MD;  for example, encouraging Jessica to try and break the
record for youngest cross-country pilot.
</p><p>
   Hathaway told reporters in Falmouth Thursday that she had no
second thoughts about how she was rearing her children and
suggested that Jessica's death should not lead other parents to
impose undue restrictions on their own.
</p><p>
   ``I beg people to let children fly if they want to fly,''
Hathaway said, crying. ``Clearly I would want all my children to
die in a state of joy, but not at age 7 ... I know Jess did her
best.''
</p><p>
   At Logan International Airport in Boston, where Hathaway left
for Wyoming, she added that she just wanted to get to Cheyenne to
``hold my child, dead or alive.''
</p><p>
   Joan Hathaway of Ashburnham, Mass., who accompanied her sister
to Logan, defended Jessica's mother. ``She was just very
supportive; she wanted her children to experience different things,
so she supported them in doing those kinds of things,'' Joan
Hathaway said.
</p><p>
   Jessica lived with her mother, 9-year-old brother Joshua, and
3-year-old sister Jasmine in Pescadero, a farming and fishing
community 50 miles south of San Francisco. Her father lived in the
nearby city of San Mateo.
</p><p>
   Both parents thought their children should be educated through
unconventional means like flying  A;N;D;MD;  to learn weather-forecasting,
geography and physics  A;N;D;MD;  riding horses and building furniture. ``I'm
the culprit,'' Lloyd Dubroff said earlier this week, when he told
reporters he first suggested Jessica try flying coast-to-coast.
</p><p>
   ``They're getting a tremendous education from having their lives
be in the real world,'' Hathaway, 41, told the San Francisco
Examiner before Jessica embarked on her attempt to set a record.
Had she succeeded, it wouldn't have been official because the
Guinness Book of World Records eliminated its ``youngest pilot''
category several years ago out of concern it might encourage unsafe
flying.
</p><p>
   Jessica, who would have turned 8 next month, had less than a
month to set the unofficial record. It was set in 1991 by Daniel
Shanklin, who was one day shy of 8 when he flew from San Diego to
Kill Devil Hills, N.C.
</p><p>
   Jessica, along with her two siblings also took music lessons,
including piano and trumpet. All were encouraged to excel and take
risks, friends and neighbors said Thursday.
</p><p>
   The Pescadero community flag was lowered to half-staff in her
memory and a local florist hung out a sign that read, ``Jessica,
you inspired all of us. Keep soaring.''
</p><p>
   For the $50-an-hour flying lessons, paid for by Lloyd Dubroff,
57, a corporate consultant in nearby San Mateo, Jessica's mother
would drive a white minivan to the hangar at Half Moon Bay Airport.
</p><p>
   Michael Benson, a spokesman for the NTSB, said, ``We will be
looking at everything related to this accident.'' He said crashes
involving child aviators are rare. ``Our initial search of NTSB
records does not turn anything up.'' He said the safety board will
``look at any regulations or requirements that could have played a
factor in this.''

OTHER PILOTS REMEMBER JOE REID, JESSICA'S FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR

<TEXT>
<p>
   HALF MOON BAY, Calif.  A;N;D;MD;  Joe Reid, who died Thursday when the
airplane he was flying with 7-year-old Jessica Dubroff and her
father crashed in Cheyenne, Wyo., took up flying the same way he
did anything else: with passion and attention to detail.
</p><p>
   ``I respected his leadership, his thoroughness,'' said Gary
Petersen, manager of Half Moon Bay Airport. ``He was always capable
and competent, a real by-the-book guy  A;N;D;MD;  very thorough, very
detailed.''
</p><p>
   Reid, 52, who for nearly 27 years was a broker at the Dean
Witter Reynolds office in Palo Alto, was president of the Half Moon
Bay Pilots Association.
</p><p>
   George Auld, a longtime friend who co-owned the aircraft that
crashed, said he had first taken Reid up in a small plane in 1970.
He said Reid, a Vietnam veteran, got his pilot's license in the
late 1970s and was certified to be an instructor about four years
ago.
</p><p>
   They bought the plane, a 1975 single-engine Cessna 177B
Cardinal, about nine years ago.
</p><p>
   ``He loved flying and helping other people learn the excitement
of flying,'' Auld said. ``Joe's not the type to do anything half
way.''
</p><p>
   Reid began giving lessons to Jessica about five months ago and
was supportive of her effort to become the youngest person ever to
make a round-trip, cross-country flight in the United States.
</p><p>
   ``I'm teaching her just like I would anybody else,'' he said.
``Mentally, she grasps the concepts as well as an adult.''
</p><p>
   Forrest Storz, who also gives flying lessons at the airport,
called Reid ``an exceptional, competent pilot.''
</p><p>
   Reid, who grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and was graduated from
Saint Mary of the Plains College in Dodge City, Kan., was active in
the Half Moon Bay community and serving a fourth term on the
Coastside County Water District board. He also was a member of the
San Mateo County Airport Land Use Committee and was chairman of the
annual Half Moon Bay Fly-In and Air Show.
</p><p>
   He and his wife, Ana, were active parishioners at Our Lady of
the Pillar Catholic Church. They had two sons, Christopher, 27, of
Occidental, and Matthew, 23, of Half Moon Bay.

   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  The Navy said Friday that a pilot was probably
showing off for his parents when he crashed an F-14A jet fighter in
Nashville in January, killing himself, a fellow officer and three
people on the ground.
</p><p>
   The pilot, Lt. Comdr. John Stacy Bates, had been grounded for a
month in April 1995 after he lost control of another F-14A after
taking off from the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln. The plane crashed
after the pilot and his crew ejected. The crew members were
rescued.
</p><p>
   Rear Adm. Bernard Smith, who investigated the Nashville crash,
said Bates' judgment was influenced by his parents' presence at the
field'' and his desire to show them risky takeoff and flight
maneuvers.
</p><p>
   The admiral said that in taking off from the Nashville airport
on Jan. 29, Bates ascended at an angle steeper than 50 degrees,
violating Navy rules.
</p><p>
   After the near-perpendicular takeoff, in the clouds, Smith said,
the pilot became disoriented, and in all likelihood did not realize
that he was heading earthward until his jet pierced the clouds at
2,300 feet.
</p><p>
   By then, the admiral said, it was too late to prevent the plane
from smashing into the house of Elmer and Ada Newsom.
</p><p>
   In addition to Bates, 33, and his radar intercept officer, Lt.
Graham Alden Higgins, 28, those killed were the Newsoms and Ewing
Wair, who was visiting them.
</p><p>
   The crash would never have happened had the pilot made a normal
take-off or taken the cloudy weather into account, Smith said after
an 11-week review of the incident.

REACTIONS TO DEATH OF ONE CHILD PILOT MAY GROUND OTHERS
(bl)
By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   PLAINVILLE, Conn.  A;N;D;MD;  The boys, ages 12 to 14, peered intensely at
their instructor, their red textbooks open to Lesson 23:
``Emergency Procedures, Wind Shear, Turbulence.'' The instructor,
John Calla, began. ``What are some types of emergencies?,'' he
asked. ``Engine failure,'' one student said. ``Electrical fire,''
said another. ``Ice,'' someone else piped in.
</p><p>
   The boys are students in Cloud Chasers, a six-year-old nonprofit
program that seeks to build motivation and raise self-esteem by
teaching young people how to fly airplanes.
</p><p>
   Every Saturday morning they practice on the ground and in the
sky with instructors from Robertson Airport, a tiny airstrip in
this tiny town just west of Hartford.
</p><p>
   The Cloud Chasers fly in planes with dual controls and with an
instructor in the next seat. They labor over pre-flight safety
checks. For practice, they simulate stalls in flight.
</p><p>
   They do not fly to break records. And they are all older than
7-year-old Jessica Dubroff, who died, with her father and flight
instructor, in a crash this month as she tried to become the
youngest person to fly across the country.
</p><p>
   But the reaction to Jessica's crash may ground these young
pilots sooner than any emergency for which they rehearse.
</p><p>
   Federal law requires student pilots to be at least 16 years old
before they are allowed to fly solo. Younger children can fly as
long as there is a licensed pilot sitting next to them at the
controls and acting as pilot in command.
</p><p>
   But since Jessica's crash, three Republican state senators from
Connecticut are seeking to ban children under the age of 16 from
flying.
</p><p>
   Sens. Kevin F. Rennie from Rocky Hill, Mark Nielsen from Danbury
and John A. Kissel from Enfield proposed the ban, and on Wednesday
the Senate voted to add it to a bill dealing with child restraints
in automobiles. The amendment states: ``No person under the age of
16 shall engage in the operation of aircraft. No person shall aid a
person under the age of 16 in the operation of aircraft.'' The bill
itself must now go before the Senate for ratification.
</p><p>
   Rennie said that he and his supporters considered the ban a
safety precaution that would close an inadvertent gap in the
federal law. He said the ban came at a time when the legislature
was also banning newly licensed drivers from the roads between
midnight and 5 a.m.
</p><p>
   ``We're putting restrictions on driving a car for six months
after you get your license,'' Rennie said. ``At the same time we
will be debating whether or not someone younger than that can be
flying an airplane, and it strikes me as one of those Kafka moments
in the legislature.
</p><p>
   But Calla, the Cloud Chasers instructor, sees the ban as
misguided.
</p><p>
   Federal safety investigators who looked into the crash said they
believed Jessica's instructor was in control of the airplane when
it went down just after takeoff.
</p><p>
   Calla and others involved with Cloud Chasers noted that the
responsibility for the flight  A;N;D;MD;  and, they say, for any pilot error
that would have contributed to the crash  A;N;D;MD;  lay with the pilot in
command, not with the 7-year-old.
</p><p>
   The ban, they say, would end one of the only programs in the
country dedicated specifically to teaching young people to fly
responsibly, and even worse, they say, would be the lost
opportunity to teach lessons about life through aviation.
</p><p>
   ``I am the adult,'' Calla said. ``I am in control of the
aircraft. I am the sole person responsible for keeping us out of
harm's way. It really aggravates me that they want to throw it all
away when we could be educating the world in the correct procedures
in handling the safe operation of aircraft, making students more
knowledgeable about the world around them, opening up their eyes to
new horizons, all in an environment that has a safety net: the
flight instructor.''
</p><p>
   Joe Tortorici, a public school art teacher who volunteers as the
director of Cloud Chasers, said that students in the program would
have known better than to take off in a storm like the one in
Wyoming this month.
</p><p>
   ``This school is designed to raise self-esteem, to foster
decision-making, including the kind of decision that would have
kept that plane on the ground,'' he said.``We're not training
pilots. We are training mature adults.''
</p><p>
   Indeed, learning how to fly also involves learning more than a
smattering of physics, mathematics and meteorology, and the Cloud
Chasers students portray a seriousness beyond their years.
</p><p>
   Neil Brewer, 14, said he would not fly in bad weather. ``It's a
safe way to play it,'' he said. ``I think that a good portion of
things we learn here are how to make judgments. We learn the more
technical aspects of flying. We learn why stalls happen. We
practice stalls and go and actually do the maneuvers in the
plane.''
</p><p>
   Nathan Sheely, 14, said he had been fascinated by planes since
birth. The hardest thing about learning to fly, he said, was
learning ``to always be a step ahead of the aircraft, to know
what's going to happen before it happens and to know what to do.''
</p><p>
   State Sen. Rennie said he had not heard of the Cloud Chasers
program until his office received a call from Calla on Wednesday.
But he said he remained firm in his belief that youngsters should
not fly.
</p><p>
   ``With Cloud Chasers you may have found the best example, with
Jessica Dubroff you may have the worst, most egregious example,''
he said. ``Most of the examples probably fall in between. We make
public policy with a broader brush and so we have to make some
decisions that apply equally to both extremes.
</p><p>
   Rennie also said he had received a call from a constituent who
lets his 9-year-old fly the family plane and who invited the
Senator to come up for a ride. Rennie begged off. ``I don't like
flying in big planes,'' the senator said, ``let alone in small
planes.''

TEXTRON DISCUSSING SALE OF PAUL REVERE UNIT TO PROVIDENT COS.
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By Stephen Walsh
c.1996 Bloomberg Business News
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Providence, Rhode Island, April 24 (Bloomberg) -- Textron Inc.
is discussing the sale of its Paul Revere Corp. disability
insurance unit to Provident Cos. Inc. for about $1 billion, a
person familiar with the talks said.
</p><p>
   The talks are part of Providence, Rhode Island-based Textron's
efforts to shed financial services units and focus on core
manufacturing businesses, which include making Cessna aircraft,
Bell helicopters and E-Z-GO golf carts.
</p><p>
   For Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Provident, an acquisition would
be the latest step in the company's effort to reorganize and expand
through insuring policyholders against loss of income if they
suffer a debilitating accident or illness.
</p><p>
   Textron Chief Financial Officer Stephen Key declined to comment
on the likelihood of selling Paul Revere. His company ``has been
saying all along'' that it plans to reduce its presence in
financial services, he said, declining to elaborate.
</p><p>
   Provident wouldn't comment on any potential acquisitions.
Provident Vice President Thomas White said, ``We have said it is
our strategy to grow Provident.''
</p><p>
   News of the talks was reported in today's Wall Street Journal.
Provident stock fell 1/8 to 30 7/8 in early trading. Textron shares
rose 3/4 to 88 7/8.
</p><p>
   Officials at Paul Revere weren't available for comment. Its
shares rose 3/4 to 25.
</p><p>
   Worcester, Massachusetts-based Paul Revere, 83 percent owned by
Textron, has been a laggard among Textron's six operating units,
and especially among its finance-oriented businesses. In 1995,
revenue at Paul Revere rose 14 percent to $1.52 billion while
operating income dropped 6 percent to $123 million. Revenue also
rose as income declined in 1994.
</p><p>
   While Paul Revere has had trouble with rising benefit costs,
results are just the opposite at Textron's Avco Financial Services
unit, a consumer finance company, and Textron Financial Corp., a
commercial finance company.
</p><p>
   Revenue in Avco and Textron Financial rose 19 percent last year
on a combined basis to $1.99 billion, with operating income
increasing 10 percent to $365 million.
</p><p>
   Given the performance at Paul Revere, Salomon Brothers analyst
George Shapiro said Textron has been looking ``to extricate''
itself from the insurance company in favor of acquiring more
manufacturing businesses.

(Las Vegas ATTN)
SOUTHWEST JET BOUND FOR BURBANK MAKES EMERGENCY LANDING
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
By MARY SCHUBERT
c.1996 Los Angeles Daily News
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  A;N;D;MD;  A Southwest Airlines jetliner en route from Las
Vegas to Burbank made an emergency landing at Ontario International
Airport after the landing gear failed to fully lower, but none of
the 132 people aboard was hurt.
</p><p>
   The left landing gear of the Boeing 737-300 failed to lower all
the way Tuesday, so the Burbank tower diverted Flight 1767 to
Ontario, which has longer runways.
</p><p>
   After several failed efforts to shake the stuck gear loose, the
pilot landed the plane in a lopsided position, with just the nose
wheel and right landing gear down.
</p><p>
   ``Everybody was really amazingly calm. I don't know whether it
was shock, but there didn't seem to be any sense of panic,'' said
Larry Spears, 49, of North Hollywood, who said he was on the
flight. ``I have been on much rougher landings with both sets of
landing gears. It was amazingly smooth.''
</p><p>
   Spears said he was returning home from an overnight getaway to
Las Vegas.
</p><p>
   The nearly full flight, with 127 passengers and five crew
members aboard, had left Las Vegas at 1 p.m. and was due in Burbank
at 2 p.m.
</p><p>
   The pilot, an eight-year Southwest veteran, landed the jetliner
safely at 2:40 p.m. on the north runway, said Melanie Jones, a
spokeswoman for the Dallas-based Southwest. She refused to identify
the pilot, citing company policy.
</p><p>
   ``No passengers or crew were injured,'' said Maria Tesoro, a
spokeswoman for Ontario Airport. ``All the passengers are safe, and
the cause of the difficulty with the landing gear is unknown.''
</p><p>
   Spears said passengers became aware of the problem when the jet
began its descent toward Burbank.
</p><p>
   ``As he was lowering the landing gear, there was a real loud
thump, much louder than normal. About 45 seconds later, there was
another loud thump,'' Spears recounted.
</p><p>
   The pilot announced that a light on the instrument panel
indicated the landing gear hadn't engaged, and he would circle the
jet past the Burbank Airport tower to see if the controllers could
spot a malfunction, Spears said.
</p><p>
   That strategy failed because the plane couldn't fly low enough
for the tower to see the wheel, so the flight was rerouted to
Ontario, located 35 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
</p><p>
   The pilot did a low fly-by past the Ontario control tower, and
at that point airport officials verified the landing gear was
stuck, Spears said.
</p><p>
   The flight crew twice tried a maneuver to knock the landing gear
free: sharply climbing and accelerating, and then abruptly cutting
back the power. ``He called it a `maximum G-force maneuver,' and it
was basically (intended) to try to jolt it down by force of
gravity,'' Spears said.
</p><p>
   ``It really was like a roller coaster. Our stomachs went up past
our throats and into our noses,'' he joked.
</p><p>
   When that technique didn't work, the pilot announced he would
try a hard touch-and-go landing on the one free wheel, in hopes the
hard impact would jolt the other wheel down, Spears said.
</p><p>
   ``He told everybody: `There's no need to be alarmed. We do this
thing all the time  A;N;D;MD;  in simulators,' and everybody groaned.''
</p><p>
   Again, the attempt failed. The pilot announced the only option
left was an emergency landing. Flight attendants began
demonstrating crash precautions as the plane circled to burn off
and dump excess fuel, Spears said.
</p><p>
   The crew asked younger, stronger passengers to sit near the
exits and help with evacuations, Spears said.
</p><p>
   Passengers were directed to take off their glasses and
high-heeled shoes. ``We started a really slow descent into the
airport,'' Spears said.
</p><p>
   ``The captain came on and said we would only be going about 60
mph. They would try to set it down on the one wheel, and they would
try to ease it down really slowly,'' he said.
</p><p>
   As the jet landed, Spears said he could see ``the fire trucks
racing down the runway beside us.'' Firefighters sprayed
fire-retardant foam on the plane as a precaution.
</p><p>
   ``The captain said: `Stay in your seats. We're on the ground
safely,''' Spears said. ``At that point, everybody cheered.''
</p><p>
   Jones said the jetliner had just undergone a ``major maintenance
inspection'' April 16, but she wasn't sure whether the landing gear
was checked at that time. Such periodic inspections are required by
the Federal Aviation Administration, she noted.
</p><p>
   ``We know that the landing gear wouldn't come down, (but) we
don't know the cause of the malfunction,'' Jones said. Southwest
and Boeing sent aircraft mechanics out to Ontario to inspect the
plane, she said.
</p><p>
   ``We took it new from Boeing eight years ago. That's very new
for an aircraft,'' Jones said.
</p><p>
   ``We have a perfect safety record for 25 years,'' Jones said.
``Occasionally, we have things go wrong, as with any piece of
equipment with mechanical parts. But we think our crew did a
wonderful job of landing the airplane.''
</p><p>
   Southwest offered the stranded passengers an option: a ride to
Burbank Airport or a motel room near the Ontario Airport, Jones
said.
</p><p>
   ``The (north) runway was closed five minutes prior to the
landing of the airplane,'' Tesoro noted, but she didn't know how
many landings and takeoffs were delayed or diverted while the north
runway was out of commission.
</p><p>
   The 737-300 was taken out of service to be repaired by Southwest
crews at Ontario, Tesoro added.

REPORT RELEASED ON INDIANA CRASH THAT KILLED 68
(bl)
By ADAM BRYANT
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Eighteen months after an American Eagle turboprop plane crashed
in Roselawn, Ind., killing all 68 people aboard, the Federal
Aviation Administration issued its answers this week to one series
of questions raised by the accident. And Monday, the agency begins
addressing new questions raised by the very same crash.
</p><p>
   Since the Roselawn crash, the agency has worked to gain a better
understanding of the effects of flying in icy weather, in
particular a rare condition in which tiny droplets of water are
suspended in the atmosphere below freezing temperature.
</p><p>
   When those liquid droplets strike a surface like an airplane
wing, they freeze on contact. Investigators believe a ridge of ice
formed on the wing of the American Eagle turboprop  A;N;D;MD;  an ATR-72  A;N;D;MD; 
causing it to tilt uncontrollably and crash.
</p><p>
   Thursday, the FAA issued a series of so-called airworthiness
directives affecting 29 types of turboprop aircraft  A;N;D;MD;  the kind
typically used by regional commuter airlines  A;N;D;MD;  that have a long
rubber bladder along the leading edge of their wings to crack and
shed ice.
</p><p>
   The regulations instruct pilots to look for signs of ice
accumulating on windows, wings or propeller hubs. If they see it,
they are supposed to change altitude or direction quickly.
</p><p>
   To reach that relatively simple ruling, however, required an
enormous amount of testing of these aircraft by the aviation agency
and their manufacturers.
</p><p>
   Those tests included measuring the tilting forces created while
taxiing at high-speeds with wooden shapes attached to the wings. In
addition, some aircraft were flown behind a tanker plane, which
sprayed them with water to see how they would perform in such
conditions.
</p><p>
   The aviation agency has determined that the French-made ATR
aircraft were the only turboprop commuter planes now flying in the
United States that required a design modification.
</p><p>
   The manufacturer, Avions de Transport Regional, with the
agency's approval, agreed to enlarge the rubber bladder along the
leading edge so that it covered more of the top of the wing. An ATR
spokeswoman said the company had modified the wings of all its
aircraft worldwide that flew in conditions where such icy weather
might occur.
</p><p>
   Anthony J. Broderick, the agency's associate administrator for
regulation and certification, said that because the tests were so
rigorous, he was confident that a crash like the one in Roselawn
would not occur again.
</p><p>
   ``We have closed the door on the safety issues,'' he said. He
added that since Roselawn, no airlines or pilots had filed reports
on planes upset in icy weather.
</p><p>
   Even so, questions about icy weather remain, and many of them
will be discussed starting Monday during a three-day conference on
in-flight icing at Springfield, Va. About 400 aviation experts from
the United States and many foreign countries are expected to
attend.
</p><p>
   Those and other discussions may lead, in months or even years,
to new standards that manufacturers must meet before the aviation
agency certifies their aircraft.
</p><p>
   The current standards have been in place since the 1940s, and
were not changed after a review in the 1960s. In broad terms, those
standards take into account most weather conditions that occur most
of the time.
</p><p>
   But as more turboprops fly more frequently, the chances of
encountering the rare but hazardous condition known as
``super-cooled drizzle drops'' rises.
</p><p>
   Broderick said his agency's goals included developing better
ways to forecast these conditions and possibly develop equipment to
alert pilots that they are flying in such conditions. Generally,
these conditions occur in relatively narrow bands in the sky, and
experts say that changing altitude by 2,000 or 3,000 feet is often
enough to escape the situation.
</p><p>
   The aviation agency is currently spending about $400,000 a year
on research into the problem. Broderick said the agency also
planned to start testing some smaller aircraft that are not used by
commercial airlines but that do use the rubber de-icing system.
</p><p>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates
accidents, is expected to issue its conclusions about what caused
the Roselawn crash within two months.

4 DIE IN CRASH OF MILITARY HELICOPTER
(sw)
By GEORGE JUDSON
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STRATFORD, Conn.  A;N;D;MD;  A helicopter making a test flight before it
was to be delivered to the Marine Corps to provide cargo service
for the White House appeared to lose its rotors on Thursday and
crashed onto the flight field of the Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.,
killing all four crew members.
</p><p>
   Hovering at the height of the nearby Sikorsky Bridge, where the
Merritt Parkway crosses the Housatonic River, the CH53E helicopter
 A;N;D;MD;  also known as the Super Stallion for its size and power  A;N;D;MD; 
appeared to be in distress, witnesses said, with smoke issuing from
it before its 40-foot rotors broke off.
</p><p>
   ``The helicopter was up in the air; it's normal for us to see
them,'' said John Nasufi, who spotted it as he was loading pizzas
from his restaurant above the river for a lunchtime delivery to the
Sikorsky workers. ``The helicopter had smoke coming out, and all of
a sudden it lost its blades, and that was it. It came straight
down.''
</p><p>
   The explosion shook nearby buildings and stopped traffic on the
bridge, from which the crushed fuselage could be seen burning on
the tarmac less than half a mile away, about 50 feet from the
river. The craft's distress had lasted long enough for one driver
to call a Bridgeport radio station to report that a helicopter was
in trouble.
</p><p>
   Sikorsky officials said all four peole on board were employees.
Their names were withheld until relatives could be notified.
</p><p>
   A spokeswoman for Sikorsky, Gina McAllister, said the heavy-lift
helicopter, which can carry a payload of 31 tons, was to be
assigned to the Marine base at Quantico, Va. The helicopter would
have been used to ferry limousines and other advance equipment for
the White House. She said it would not have carried the president.
</p><p>
   The crash occurred at 11:08 a.m. Witnesses differed as to
whether the craft had burst into flames before it dropped onto the
flight field, or upon impact. But many said that before the craft
fell, its three rotor blades shot off. One landed across the
Housatonic River, which borders the Sikorsky property, one flew
toward the Sikorsky Bridge, and the third fell toward the assembly
plant.
</p><p>
   Ms. McAllister said the cause of the crash was not known. With
the approval of the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board, she said, Sikorsky Aircraft
would conduct the safety investigation with the participation of
the Navy Safety Center.
</p><p>
   The Marine Corps and the Navy have purchased 150 of the
heavy-lift helicopters, which can be used for amphibious assaults,
carrying cargo and recovering aircraft, according to Jane's All the
World's Aircraft. CH53E's were used to rescue Air Force Capt. Scott
O'Grady when he was shot down over Bosnia, and to evacuate the U.S.
embassy in Somalia, Ms. McAllister said.
</p><p>
   ``This helicopter has a very proud tradition, and the Sikorsky
family is devastated by this mishap,'' she said.

HELICOPTER CRASH KILLS 14 MARINES
(inserts new material after 3rd graf to give some of victims'

<p>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C.  A;N;D;MD;  Fourteen marines were killed and two were
injured before dawn Friday when two helicopters collided and
plunged into a densely forested marsh in an isolated part of this
Marine Corps base in eastern North Carolina.
</p><p>
   The cause of the crash, which happened at 2 a.m. during a huge
U.S.-British amphibious-assault exercise, is still under
investigation, officials said.
</p><p>
   Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition at Pitt
County Memorial Hospital in Greenville, N.C., and the other was
listed in serious condition at the base hospital. No British troops
were involved in the crash.
</p><p>
   The Associated Press reported that officials at the base
identified three of the dead as First Lt. Arthur J. Schneider of
Livingston, N.J.,; Maj. Michael D. Kuszewski of Fort Devens, Mass.
and Capt. Scott T. Rice of Springfield, Mo.
</p><p>
   By midafternoon 11 bodies of the crash victims had been
recovered from the scene. But it took until about 4:30 p.m. for the
final three bodies to be recovered from the muddy and wooded area
where rescuers toiled for more than 16 hours. It was an indication,
a marine spokesman said, of the conditions in the forest.
</p><p>
   The search was hampered as tractors sank up to their tread tops
in the muck and rescuers resorted to cutting pathways with
chainsaws and fashioning walkways over the shifting ground with
slabs of plywood.
</p><p>
   ``It is very thick pine forest and swamp,'' said Maj. Steve
Little, a spokesman. ``It has been difficult, especially difficult
before dawn as we began the recovery. It has been made easier with
more light.''
</p><p>
   Little said the marines were part of a joint exercise including
38,200 U.S. troops and 15,600 British troops. The helicopters
involved were an AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter with a
two-person crew and a CH-46E Sea Knight, an assault and transport
helicopter that can carry as many as 22 people in addition to its
crew of four.
</p><p>
   The helicopters had taken off earlier that night from ships
massed off the North Carolina coast and headed inland to where the
accident occurred near the Courthouse Bay boat basin at the
150,000-acre military base.
</p><p>
   Flight operations in the British-U.S. exercises were suspended,
although surface operations would continue, Little said.
</p><p>
   Friday's accident was deadliest for the Marine Corps since 1989,
when 14 people were killed in the crash of another Sea Knight off
Okinawa. More than twice as many marines have died in aviation
accidents in the last eight months as were killed in such accidents
in the previous two years. The total killed so far this year in
aviation accidents, counting Friday's deaths, is 19. In 1995 there
were six aviation deaths and in 1994 there were only three such
deaths.
</p><p>
   It was a Harrier jet crash here in 1993 that prompted the Marine
Corps to order a rare 48-hour suspension of all fixed-wing and
helicopter flights to conduct emergency safety checks. In that
year, 12 people were killed in aircraft accidents. As recently as
March the Marine Corps called another two-day halt to all aircraft
flights for emergency checks.
</p><p>
   Col. Joe C. Yannessa, commander of the rescue operation, said
the collision had occurred in midair over the densely pine-forested
marshland and rained debris over a 150 yard area. Yannessa said
rescue crews on foot and carrying nothing more than their packs and
hand-held fire extinguishers got to the section of swamp 600 yards
from the nearest road within 30 minutes of the crash. There were
several smoldering, but not intense, fires scattered throughout the
area, he said.
</p><p>
   ``The aircraft frankly is in such a state of destruction that
there are no identifying marks that we could see on the aircraft,''
Yannessa said. ``They were sunk 3 to 4 to 5 feet into the muck.''

109 FEARED DEAD AS JETLINER CRASHES IN EVERGLADES
(Eds: This is a late addition to The New York Times front page.)

<p>
   A Valujet DC-9 jetliner with 109 people aboard crashed in the
Florida Everglades shortly after takeoff from Miami International
Airport on Saturday afternoon. Aviation and rescue officials found
widely scattered debris and said there were apparently no
survivors.
</p><p>
   Bound for Atlanta, the twin-engine aircraft was about 30 miles
northwest of Miami airport when the pilot reported smoke in the
cockpit, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said.
The plane was believed to be turning back to the airport when radar
contact was lost shortly after 2 p.m.
</p><p>
   ``We believe that the aircraft is down somewhere in the vicinity
of the Florida Everglades,'' the FAA spokesman, Anthony Willett,
said.
</p><p>
   The cause of the crash was unclear. Valujet Airlines Inc., which
is based in Atlanta and serves 26 cities in 17 states, began
operations in 1993 with an old fleet that has grown to about 50
planes.
</p><p>
   It has experienced a number of problems, including several
aircraft that have run off runways and one that caught fire, but
never a crash.
</p><p>
   Television pictures from helicopters flying over the Everglades
at midafternoon showed no shattered fuselage, tail assembly or
other large sections of the plane, only what appeared to be widely
scattered pieces of whitish debris that flecked the high grasses
and desolate swamps. It was unclear how deep the water was.
</p><p>
   The FAA said the crash site was 15 miles west of Opa Locka, or
about 20 miles northwest of Miami. But it was unclear by late
Saturday afternoon whether the precise crash site had been located.
</p><p>
   One aerial picture showed a depression and what appeared to be
scorched earth, but rescue pilots found no clear signs of wreckage
or survivors from Valujet's Flight 592, a daily two-hour flight
from Miami to Atlanta.
</p><p>
   The crash site appeared to be inaccessible by road. The Coast
Guard dispatched rescue helicopters and aircraft to the site, and
airboats were being mustered to carry rescue and other emergency
personnel to the area.
</p><p>
   Valujet said in a statement that the plane was carrying 104
passengers and a crew of five. Earlier reports had said that as
many as 112 and as few as 90 were on board.
</p><p>
   Valujet's fleet, said to be the oldest in the industry, has run
into a series of problems in the last two and a half years, the
most serious being a fire on June 8 last year that destroyed a DC-9
on a runway in Atlanta.
</p><p>
   A flight attendant was burned and six other injuries were
reported as 57 passengers and 5 crew members were evacuated.
</p><p>
   An FAA investigation in the wake of the fire found ``a
significant decrease in the experience level of new pilots being
hired by Valujet as well as other positions, such as mechanics and
dispatchers.''
</p><p>
   The inquiry said Valujet's rapid expansion from two to 48 planes
had been accompanied by accidents and incidents involving
inexperienced pilots, inadequate maintenance and insufficiently
trained flight attendants.

   Valujet, which had proclaimed itself the fastest-growing airline
in history, said last month that it would buy fewer airplanes than
it planned this year and would ``concentrate on its product
integrity'' in anticipation of the summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</p><p>
   Last Jan. 12, a Valujet DC-9 with 30 people aboard slid into a
snowbank after landing at Dulles International Airport outside
Washington, closing the airport for three hours.
</p><p>
   On Jan. 26, another a Valujet DC-9 got stuck in the mud at
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport and 101 passengers had to
be bused back to the terminal.
</p><p>
   On Feb. 28, another Valujet plane ran off a runway in Savannah,
Ga. And on Mar. 19, an emergency chute inflated inside the cabin of
a Valujet plane in Tampa, Fla., slightly injuring a flight
attendant; the pilot had to crawl out a window, climb into the
plane through the tailcone and cut the chute with a knife to free
the attendant.
</p><p>
   Because of the inaccessibility of Saturday's crash site, few
details were available in the hours immediately after the plane
went down. In its statement, Valujet said that Flight 592 had left
Miami at about 2:15 p.m., more than 70 minutes after its regularly
scheduled departure time.
</p><p>
   It said the DC-9-32, a McDonnell-Douglas plane configured with
seats for 113 passengers, radioed at 2:25 p.m. that it was
returning to Miami.
</p><p>
   The Valujet statement did not mention smoke in the cabin, but
other reports said the pilot had spoken to air-traffic controllers
of smoke in the cabin.
</p><p>
   The airline quoted preliminary reports as saying the plane went
down about 20 miles northwest of Miami ``in a dense area of the
Florida Everglades, making accessibility difficult.''
</p><p>
   Three hours after the crash, the FAA reported that the jet had
been about 100 miles northwest of Miami when the pilot reported
smoke in the cockpit, and that after turning around had gone about
80 miles before crashing.
</p><p>
   The FAA report said the plane had apparently gone into a steep
dive and exploded on impact.
</p><p>
   A student pilot, Rick DeLisle, who was flying a small plane in
the area with an instructor, bound for Naples, Fla, told CNN of
witnessing the crash. After hearing his instructor yelling, DeLisle
said, ``I turned and saw an explosion.''
</p><p>
   ``There was nothing in the sense of fire,'' he said. ``It was
almost like what I would call a mushroom cloud. It went up 100
feet.''
</p><p>
   DeLisle said he and his instructor flew closer and examined the
ground with binoculars. ``We got down to about 200 feet or so, and
with the binocs it looked like a large trash bag worth of debris.''
</p><p>
   As word of the crash was flashed over news reports, relatives of
people who had been on board went to Miami International Airport,
seeking information on what had happened.
</p><p>
   Hernando Vergera, an airport spokesman, said the Office of Dade
County Aviation was bringing counselors to meet with family
members, about 50 of whom were at the airport. They were being
taken to an undisclosed location for privacy, Vergera said.
</p><p>
   Valujet personnel at the airport declined to comment, and had
minimal contact with the families of the victims, Vergera said.
Valujet did not immediately return telephone messages.
</p><p>
   The Coast Guard told The Associated Press that rescue aircraft
were helping to look for wreckage and survivors. But all that
rescue pilots could detect was scorched earth, Petty Officer Angela
Weeks said.

109 FEARED DEAD IN EVERGLADES CRASH
By GEORGE BENNETT
c.1996 Cox News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MIAMI  A;N;D;MD;  A ValuJet DC-9 jetliner headed for Atlanta with 109
people on board crashed in the marshy Everglades about 20 miles
northwest of Miami International Airport Saturday.
</p><p>
   Flight 592 plunged into a swampy expanse of sawgrass more about
10 miles from the nearest road in an area accessible only by
helicopter or airboat.
</p><p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Flight 592 was about
100 miles west of Miami when its pilot reported smoke in the
cockpit and turned to go back to Miami shortly after 2 p.m.
</p><p>
   An eyewitness said the plane dived nose down at a 75-degree
angle.
</p><p>
   ``Nothing could have survived that,'' said Daniel Muelhaupt, who
told CNN he was piloting a private plane with a student and was
about two miles from the DC-9.
</p><p>
   Muelhaupt said he first thought the plane was a smaller craft
practicing maneuvers. He saw no smoke or fire coming from the
plane, Muelhaupt said.
</p><p>
   His flying student, Rick DeLisle, told CNN the impact of the
plane created a mushroom cloud about 100 feet high.
</p><p>
   ``It just looked like a large trash bag was blown open,''
DeLisle said.
</p><p>
   The plane crashed into at least four feet of water and debris
sank into several feet of muck below, fire-rescue officials said.
</p><p>
   All that was visible from the air was flotsam spread over a
50-yard area.
</p><p>
   The crash site is about 20 miles northwest of the airport in an
area inhabited primarily by snakes, alligators and mosquitos.
Rescue workers put out a call for anti-venin as a precaution
against possible snake bites.
</p><p>
   ``Accessibility is extremely difficult,'' said Metro-Dade Lt.
Luis Fernandez.
</p><p>
   ``You cannot see the total fuselage,'' said R.D. Paulison,
director of Metro-Dade Fire Rescue. ``There were no tail pieces to
see. There were no wing pieces to see. There was nothing at all.''
</p><p>
   A sheen of highly flammable aviation fuel on the water hampered
initial rescue efforts and attempts to recover the plane's flight
recorder, or ``black box.''
</p><p>
   A National Transportation Safety Board investigator said the
recorder aboard Flight 592 was an older model that would not
provide as many clues to the crash as newer, more sophisticated
models.
</p><p>
   A plane crash in a swamp is one of the worst-case scenarios in
the rescue business, said John Wright, a special operations chief
for Palm Beach County Fire Rescue, which practiced such a rescue
last month.
</p><p>
   Between the waist-deep watery mud, sawgrass so sharp it can
slice rescue worker's gear and the alligators and snakes, access is
a nightmare, Wright said.
</p><p>
   Along the Tamiami Trail about 10 miles south of the crash site,
dozens of private airboat owners lined the road volunteering their
services to rescue workers. By nightfall, though, authorities had
sent them home, and police were turning away visitors.
</p><p>
   Rescue and recovery workers were setting up camp Saturday night
near the site along the levee of the L-67 Canal, hanging mosquito
netting and lights from their boats as they settled in for the
night.
</p><p>
   At Miami International Airport, about 50 or 60 family members of
Flight 592 passengers arrived in the first 2{ hours after the crash
and were shepherded to a private area where counselors and clergy
were on hand.
</p><p>
   It was the first crash of a commercial flight arriving or
departing at Miami International since December 1972, when an
Eastern Airlines L-1011 crashed in the Everglades approaching the
airport and 101 of 176 aboard were killed.
</p><p>
   It was the first fatal accident involving ValuJet since the
bargain airline began operations in October 1993.
</p><p>
   But ValuJet has had several safety problems over the last year.
</p><p>
   In June, an engine fire spread through the fuselage of a ValuJet
plane on the runway at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta,
burning a flight attendant and destroying the plane.
</p><p>
   Since January, three ValuJet planes have run off runways in bad
weather, and two planes have been knocked out of service after hard
landings. There were no injuries in any of those incidents.
</p><p>
   The Atlanta-based carrier began with two used planes in 1993 and
has expanded to about 50. But it announced last month it would take
a break from its rapid growth ``to concentrate on its product
integrity prior to the commencement of the Olympic Games,'' the
airline said.
</p><p>
   ``This decision has been made, in part, in response to increased
(FAA) scrutiny and requirements relating to the company that
resulted from recent incidents involving the company's aircraft,''
the airline said at the time.

COLORADO STOCKS: UAL RISES 2.8% TO LEAD INDEX TO RECORD HIGH
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Denver, May 13 (Bloomberg) -- Colorado stocks climbed to a
record high as UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, rose in the
wake of the crash of a ValuJet Inc. DC-9 this weekend.
</p><p>
   The Bloomberg Colorado Stock Index rose 0.86, or 0.61 percent,
to 141.07. Advancers outnumbered decliners 48 to 35 in the
price-weighted index that tracks shares of companies with
operations in the state.
</p><p>
   In the broader U.S. stock market, the Standard A;N;D;AMP; Poor's 500
Index rose 9.42, or 1.44 percent, to 661.51. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average climbed 64.46, or 1.17 percent, to 5582.60.
</p><p>
   UAL rose 6, or 2.8 percent, to 214, as the stocks of major U.S.
airlines registered their biggest one-day advance in almost a
month. The SA;N;D;AMP;P airline index rose 12.37 to 344.53, with investors
favoring established carriers over recent start-ups.
</p><p>
   UAL is included in Colorado's index because of its dominant
position in the state's economy.
</p><p>
   Investors said Saturday's crash of a ValuJet DC-9 in the Florida
Everglades cast a pall over the ability of fledgling airlines to
raise sufficient capital to replace older jets. The crash killed
109 people. ``People have been able to get financing fairly
readily,'' said Joseph Ray of Gerald L. Ray A;N;D;AMP; Associates, a Dallas
money management firm that oversees $500 million in assets. ``It
will be interesting to see what the capital markets say about all
this.''
</p><p>
   Among those carriers that Ray is watching is Colorado
Springs-based Western Pacific Airlines Inc., which fell 3/4 to 15
3/4 to lead the state's declining issues. Western Pacific hopes to
add eight aircraft to its 14-plane fleet by the end of 1996.
</p><p>
   Denver-based Frontier Airlines Inc., which fell 3/4 to 7 5/8, is
also growing. The airline, which marks its second anniversary in
July, is putting its eighth and ninth aircraft into service this
summer, and hopes to add at least a couple more Boeing 737s this
year.
</p><p>
   The state's other airline, cargo carrier Atlas Air Inc., fell
7/16 to 53 13/16.
</p><p>
   Other advancing stocks included Lockheed Martin Corp., up 2 n1/8
at 83 1/4; Amrion Inc., up 1 1/2 at 18 5/8; Exabyte Corp., up 5/8
at 20 5/8; and Newmont Mining Corp., up 5/8 at 59 1/8. Other
declining issues included Boston Chicken Inc., off 5/8 at 35 7/8,
even though it reported first-quarter profit doubled.
</p><p>
   Adolph Coors Co. fell 7/16 to 17 13/16, while FirstMiss Gold
Corp., dropped 3/8 to 37 5/8.
</p><p>
   The Colorado index has gained 18.62 percent since the first of
the year, compared with the SA;N;D;AMP;P 500's 7.40 percent advance.

CRASH INVESTIGATORS BRAVE ENVIRONMENT RECOVER `BLACK BOX,' BODY
PARTS; SEARCH CONTINUES FOR SECOND RECORDER, CAUSE
EDs: With CRASH-PILOT, CRASH-ID, CRASH-FAA.
By GARY KANE and JOHN FERNANDEZ
c.1996 Cox News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MIAMI  A;N;D;MD;  Undaunted by a hostile environment, crash scene
investigators extracted a flight data recorder and dozens of body
parts Monday from the marshy grave of ValuJet Flight 592.
</p><p>
   The discovery marked the first real victory for recovery crews
since the aircraft nosedived into a desolate expanse of the Florida
Everglades two days ago.
</p><p>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators said the
``black box,'' which was in the powder-blue tail of the DC-9
aircraft, was located during a plotted-grid search of the crash
site.
</p><p>
   The flight data recorder measures altitude, speed and
acceleration of the aircraft at the time of an accident. The device
will be taken to an NTSB laboratory in Washington where it will be
analyzed for clues to the cause of Saturday's crash.
</p><p>
   Search crews are still looking for a second recorder which is
designed to capture the conversations in the cockpit.
</p><p>
   The Atlanta-bound plane crashed roughly nine minutes after
takeoff from Miami's airport with 104 passengers and five crew
members. The flight crew reported smoke in the cockpit and cabin
before the tower lost contact.
</p><p>
   While a marksman atop an airboat scanned for alligators and
poisonous water moccasins, five teams of Metro-Dade police divers
took turns wading through the waist-deep soup of water and muck.
The walked gingerly, groping with their hands and feet for chucks
of debris or remains of victims.
</p><p>
   The six members of each crew were linked to each other with rope
 A;N;D;MD;  muck beneath the surface water is soft enough in spots to swallow
trespassers. Gooey and black, the muck is full of decaying plant
material. South Florida Water Management District specialists at
the site measured muck at 3-5 feet deep with 12-18 inches of water
atop.
</p><p>
   Like archaeologists working a dig, the investigators marked the
search area in square plots.
</p><p>
   The site, sandwiched between two canals, is just east of the
Miccosukee Indian Reservation and nine miles from Route 41. It is
roughly 16 miles northwest of the Miami airport runway.
</p><p>
   Helicopters shuttle searchers to the site, where they work in
shifts of about 20 minutes. They wear hazardous-material gear and
masks and tightly tape pant legs and shirt sleeves for added
protection against irritating jet fuel and bacteria in the water.
At the end of each shift, the teams remove their dive suits and
drop them in barrels of disinfectants.
</p><p>
   Investigators said they have little hope of finding any intact
bodies. The aircraft reportedly plunged into the marshland at a
75-degree angle at an estimated speed of 500 mph.
</p><p>
   About 40 body parts were recovered Sunday  A;N;D;MD;  nothing larger than
a knee. By noon Monday, seven body bags of remains were loaded onto
an airboat normally used for everglades tours and taken to a levee
where emergency vehicles and vans from the medical examiners office
assemble.
</p><p>
   As the grim search progressed, federal transportation officials
in Washington provided new details about the stepped-up scrutiny of
ValuJet.
</p><p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration had been reviewing ValuJet's
operations since February because of a series of problem flights.
Saturday's crash prompted FAA officials to begin a month of
intensive inspections of Valujet's maintenance plants and cockpit
procedures.
</p><p>
   Inspectors are visiting Valujet's 29 field maintenance
facilities where mechanics handle minor repairs and make sure
planes are ready for their next flight. The FAA also wants to check
work at six contractor maintenance facilities used by the airline.
Among them: Aero Thrust in Miami, where engine repairs are made,
Aero Corp. in Lake City, which handles airframe work, and Sabre
Tech in Miami.
</p><p>
   The crash has sparked questions about the age of Valujet's
fleet. The DC-9 that crashed Saturday was 27 years old. But FAA
officials suggested Monday that older aircraft can be perfectly
safe because any plane 15 years or older is required to have
frequent inspections.
</p><p>
   CBS News reported that the FAA was to be investigated as part of
an overall probe being conducted in the wake of the crash by the
Department of Transportation.
</p><p>
   CBS said the Department of Transportation was looking into the
possibility the FAA knew Valujet was headed for trouble before the
crash. The network said the FAA declined to comment on the probe.
</p><p>
   ValuJet Airlines stock dropped sharply Monday, the first day of
trading since the crash and also the first day of intensified
federal scrutiny of the Atlanta-based carrier. It closed on the
Nasdaq Stock Market down $4.18} a share at $13.68}. This story was
supplemented by wire service material.

IT'S INVESTIGATORS VERSUS NATURE AT EVERGLADES CRASH SCENE
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   THE EVERGLADES, Fla.  A;N;D;MD;  With a government sniper patrolling for
alligators and snakes, 30 divers Monday combed the mud and inky
waters of this vast swamp in a gruesome search that yielded one of
the two flight recorders from doomed Flight 592.
</p><p>
   Federal investigators are hoping the flight-data recorder, also
known as a ``black box,'' will offer clues about the cause of the
crash that took 109 lives Saturday afternoon, when a ValuJet DC-9
nose-dived into a desolate stretch of saw grass, water and ooze
about 15 miles northwest of Miami.
</p><p>
   ``We're encouraged that we found it and hope we can find the
second one which recorded conversations in the cockpit,'' said Mike
Benson, a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board.
</p><p>
   Rescuers also continued the grim search for bodies. By midday
seven body bags of remains had been removed.
</p><p>
   ``I don't hold any hope we'll find any recoverable large parts
of people,'' said retired Dade County Medical Examiner Joseph
Davis, who is taking part in the investigation.
</p><p>
   The flight-data recorder found Monday by divers measures
altitude, speed and acceleration of the aircraft at the time of an
accident. But some investigators believe more significant
information will be contained in the box that recorded the crew's
conversations.
</p><p>
   Meanwhile, CBS News reported that the Federal Aviation
Administration was to be investigated as part of an overall probe
being conducted in the wake of the crash by the Department of
Transportation.
</p><p>
   CBS said the Transportation Department was looking into the
possibility the FAA knew ValuJet was headed for trouble before the
crash. The network said the FAA declined to comment on the probe.
</p><p>
   The FAA Monday began an intensive review of ValuJet, in which
FAA inspectors were to ride in the cockpits and review the
company's maintenance facilities for the next month.
</p><p>
   President Clinton said he directed Transportation Secretary
Federico Pena to report this week on the additional measures the
Transportation Department and the FAA plan to take to ensure US
airlines ``continue to operate at the highest level of safety.''
</p><p>
   ``I'm determined to do everything I can to make sure American
aviation is the safest in the world,'' Clinton said.
</p><p>
   Although officials were buoyed by retrieving the flight-data
recorder, officials from a widening array of civilian and military
agencies remained stymied about how to retrieve pieces of the
airliner from what one investigator called the most difficult scene
ever encountered for recovering a large passenger plane.
</p><p>
   ``We're going to have to be prepared for the fact that this may
take us some time,'' said Robert Francis, vice chairman of the
NTSB.
</p><p>
   Francis would not say whether investigators might ultimately
have to leave victims and large portions of the plane entombed in
the swamp, which sucked the entire airliner into its murky depths.
</p><p>
   But the problems associated with retrieving the submerged craft
from a site more than 300 yards from the nearest road mounted even
as new plans for recovery were considered.
</p><p>
   ``At any accident site you end up leaving something, you never
recover every single part,'' Francis said.
</p><p>
   Francis said investigators and salvage crews haven't ruled out
any option for retreiving the wreckage. Nevertheless, an early plan
to build a new road to the scene of the crash has been frowned upon
because of environmental considerations.
</p><p>
   Although the federally protected Everglades National Park  A;N;D;MD;  home
to rare animals, birds and plants  A;N;D;MD;  is posing unprecedented hurdles
to government salvage crews, it is considered environmentally
fragile due in part to pollution from nearby sugar cane farms.
</p><p>
   A plan to build an artificial dam around the crash site, so that
water can be drained from the area around the wreckage, has also
met with skeptisim. Local geologists say the rock underlying the
swamp is so porous that water would inevitably seep back into the
site.
</p><p>
   Other potential recovery plans include construction of a
floating staging area near the wreckage and the erection of
temporay bridging from the nearest roadways.
</p><p>
   Monday, US Navy salvage experts arrived began searching for the
flight-data recorder with an underwater listening device called a
hydrophone to try picking up radio signals emitted from the data
recorder.
</p><p>
   The box has a ``pinger'' that transmits a signal for 30 days.
But the signal would be activated only if the data recorder rests
in water and may be impossible to pick up if the box is covered in
mud.
</p><p>
   ``The equipment is designed for ocean operations, not for swamp
operations,'' said Greg Geisen, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon.
He added that Navy personnel on the scene ``don't know the terrain.
They're still trying to assess if they can even possibly assist.''
</p><p>
   The Navy salvage experts include the head of diving and salvage
operations at the Navy Sea Systems Command and a civilian expert
from the firm of Oceaneering Technologies in Maryland.
</p><p>
   Federal officials Monday also continued to paint a harrowing
picture of the aircraft's passengers and crew, which encountered
smoke in both the cockpit and cabin before the plane plunged into
the Everglades at an estimated speed of more than 500 m.p.h.
</p><p>
   The crew, speaking with great urgency just minutes after leaving
Miami International Airport, made its last transmission at 2:13
p.m., asking air traffic controllers for the location of the
airport  A;N;D;MD;  then failed to respond when the information was given.
</p><p>
   NTSB investigator Greg Feith said it was impossible to say
whether the crew was conscious.
</p><p>
   Meanwhile, the recovery of human remains continued with urgency,
due to rapid decomposition caused by subtropical weather, swamp
bacteria and spilled fuel.
</p><p>
   Dr. Roger Mittelman, the Dade County medical examiner, said the
largest remain recovered so far was a knee. He said his office
would rely on heart pacemakers, teeth, fingerprints, tatooed skin
and DNA tests to identify the bodies. He said officials also would
test for the presence of carbon dioxide in the remains, which could
indicate whether the cabin was on fire when the plane went down.
</p><p>
   Many high level officials were giving much credit to the divers
who, because of the jet fuel and other contaminants in the water,
taped themselves into airtight protective body wrap before donning
rubber suits to work 20-minute shifts in water with near-zero
visibility.
</p><p>
   For the most part, officials said, divers searched blindly for
bodies and wreckage using their hands, feet and long poles.
</p><p>
   ``It's not the most efficient of operations,'' Francis said.
``It's tough going.''

PILOTS REMEMBERED AS `VERY SAFETY CONSCIOUS'
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III
c.1996 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Candalyn ``Candi'' Chamberlin Kubeck was apparently the first
female captain killed in a commercial airline crash, and one of
only a few female commercial pilots killed in a crash, other pilots
said Monday.
</p><p>
   Pilots, friends and family praised Kubeck and her co-pilot,
First Officer Richard Sherrill Hazen, as experienced and ``very
safety conscious,'' with excellent flying records. They were among
the 109 killed Saturday when ValuJet Airlines Flight 592 plummeted
into the Florida Everglades.
</p><p>
   One of the only other female pilots killed on duty in a
commercial crash was the co-pilot of a United Airlines 737 that
crashed in 1991 in Colorado Springs, Colo., said Beverly Bass, an
American Airlines captain and founder of the International Society
of Women Airline Pilots.
</p><p>
   Kubeck had been involved in two previous aircraft incidents as
pilot, neither of them serious, Federal Aviation Administration
records show.
</p><p>
   In November 1991, Kubeck was flying a Fairchild Metro 3
twin-engine turboprop for Grand Airways Inc., a now-defunct
sightseeing and commuter airline that operated between Las Vegas
and the Grand Canyon Airport in Arizona.
</p><p>
   Upon landing at the Grand Canyon Airport, the propeller of the
aircraft's left engine struck a deer on the runway. There were no
injuries and no significant damage to the aircraft, FAA records
show.
</p><p>
   On Sept. 2, 1994, Kubeck was piloting another McDonnell Douglas
DC-9 for ValuJet when the plane skidded sideways on a wet runway
during a landing in Chicago, records show.
</p><p>
   There were no injuries, but the jet had to be towed to the gate,
records show.
</p><p>
   FAA records show that Kubeck passed a checkride in a simulator
after the incident, scoring a ``high grade.'' No FAA enforcement
action was taken against her for her performance during the skid,
although the incident report indicated that she had failed to
maintain directional control of the aircraft.
</p><p>
   Each of the earlier events involving Kubeck was classified by
the FAA as an ``air carrier incident,'' rather than the more
serious ``accident.''
</p><p>
   Kubeck, a 35-year-old San Diego native, lived with her
airline-captain husband in Phoenix and maintained an apartment in
Bedford, Texas, where she was based at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
She was first licensed as a pilot in 1978 at age 17 in Encinitas,
Calif., a San Diego suburb.
</p><p>
   In February 1983, in the wake of President Reagan's firing of
striking air traffic controllers, Kubeck became a controller in the
El Paso Airport control tower, the FAA said. She left that job in
1984 to pursue a career as a professional pilot.
</p><p>
   She had FAA licenses as an air-transport pilot, certificated
flight instructor (airplane and instrument) and control-tower
operator, and had ratings to fly single- and multiengine airplanes.
She was qualified to fly the Boeing 737, Beech 1900, DC-9 and
Fairchild Metro 3 aircraft.
</p><p>
   Kubeck had 8,805 flight hours, including 5,388 hours as a
captain or pilot in command, ValuJet officials reported. Since
joining ValuJet in late 1993, she had accumulated 2,073 flight
hours with the airline, including 1,697 as a captain in the DC-9.
</p><p>
   She last passed the required annual first-class pilot's medical
exam April 12, records show.
</p><p>
   As a pilot, she was ``very experienced, very well-trained, very
competent,'' ValuJet President Lewis Jordan said.
</p><p>
   Hazen, 52, was also assigned to ValuJet's D/FW base, from which
the airline operates as many as five daily round trips to its main
hub, Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport.
</p><p>
   Hazen, a retired Air Force pilot, had 6,146 flight hours. He
lived in Mineola, a small city northeast of Tyler in East Texas,
and had been flying for ValuJet since November, a family spokesman
said.
</p><p>
   He previously worked for Federal Express and for an airline
taking tourists to Mexico, said his stepdaughter, Kimberly Reedy of
Irving.
</p><p>
   FAA records show that Hazen had an air-transport pilot's
license, as well as a flight engineer's certificate. His ratings
included single- and multiengine aircraft, and he passed the
first-class medical exam in September 1995.
</p><p>
   As a pilot, Hazen was ``very safety conscious,'' son-in-law Marc
Reedy said. ``He was proud of his safety record and proud to be a
pilot.''
</p><p>
   Kimberly Reedy said the tragedy is ``hard to believe.'' Hazen
used to take her for rides in his two-seat plane and ``just fly
around for fun.''
</p><p>
   ``He loved to fly,'' she said. ``That was what he always wanted
to do.''

FATHER SAYS VALUJET PILOT HAD LIFELONG LOVE OF PLANES
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
By STEVE GETZUG
c.1996 Los Angeles Daily News
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   LOS ANGELES  A;N;D;MD;  Hugh Chamberlin never had any worries about his
daughter's well-being while she piloted commercial jets.
</p><p>
   Candalyn ``Candi'' Kubeck, her father said Monday, was an
experienced aviator who turned a childhood love for airplanes into
a career that won her family's admiration.
</p><p>
   ``She was such a careful pilot, which is why I think it was the
equipment on Flight 592,'' said Chamberlin, a resident of the
Encino section of Los Angeles. ``I think that something electrical
probably flooded the cockpit with toxic fumes ... Nothing could be
done.''
</p><p>
   Kubeck, believed to be the first woman commercial jetliner
captain to die in a U.S. crash, was among 104 passengers and five
crew members killed Saturday when her ValuJet plane crashed into
the Florida Everglades.
</p><p>
   The Atlanta-bound DC-9 crashed shortly after takeoff from Miami.
The crew radioed urgently about smoke in the cockpit and cabin
before the tower lost contact.
</p><p>
   The crash and Kubeck's death has left her family devastated.
</p><p>
   Kubeck, who first entered a major airline cockpit in 1989,
turned 35 Friday. Chamberlin said he and his wife, Joan, had
planned to take their daughter to see ``Beauty and the Beast'' in
Los Angeles on Wednesday to celebrate.
</p><p>
   ``We were overwhelmed by this event, this tragedy,'' Chamberlin
said. ``She loved to fly. She expressed so much intelligence and so
much love. Those are the things that will be with us.''
</p><p>
   Kubeck's husband, Roger Kubeck, is a pilot with American West
Airlines.
</p><p>
   Family members say Candi Kubeck was captivated by the military
aircraft she saw in the skies while growing up in Southern
California. She hoped to fly, just like her grandfather who flew
biplanes during World War I.
</p><p>
   Kubeck studied at the Berkeley Hall School in Bel-Air and
Palomar College near San Marcos.
</p><p>
   She graduated from Metropolitan State College in Denver, where
she studied aviation and competed in a flight team that challenged
teams from the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs.
</p><p>
   She began her career as a pilot instructor at small airfields
and working at various commuter and freight airlines. Her career
breakthrough came in 1989, when she crossed the picket lines at
Eastern Airlines.
</p><p>
   Chamberlin, a management consultant, said the airlines' training
facilities were among the best in the industry, and his daughter
learned to fly some of the nation's largest and most modern jets,
including Eastern's biggest plane, the Airbus 300.
</p><p>
   She was hired in 1993 at ValuJet.
</p><p>
   Chamberlin said his daughter never expressed safety concerns at
ValuJet, but recalled Kubeck noting that some of the fleet had
reached a ``pretty senior age.''
</p><p>
   He said she was excited about the company's recent orders for
new planes from the McDonnell Douglas Corp.
</p><p>
   The ValuJet DC-9 that crashed Saturday was 27 years old.
</p><p>
   Patrice King, who is setting up a scholarship fund in her
stepsister's memory, said flying was Kubeck's ``lifelong passion.''
</p><p>
   ``We feel that the scholarship fund is something that Candi
would like to have done, to help others live out her dream,'' King
said.
</p><p>
   The Kubecks were married for eight years and have no children.
</p><p>
   Her family has established the Candi Chamberlin Kubeck
Scholarship Fund for Aspiring Young Pilots. Contributions may be
sent to King at Home Savings of America, 17107 Ventura Blvd.,
Encino, Calif. 91316.

FAA SAFETY CHECK WEAKNESSES REPORTED BY PROBERS BEFORE CRASH
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By AARON ZITNER
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  Two weeks before ValuJet Flight 592 carried its 109
passengers to their deaths in the Everglades, federal auditors
reported that the Federal Aviation Administration's airplane safety
checks lacked some of the basic elements of a common automobile
inspection.
</p><p>
   Tuesday, as the FAA responded to the ValuJet crash with a plan
to hire more inspectors quickly, those same examiners cautioned
again that the agency should also change its inspection and
training procedures to make the skies safer. Congressional critics
echoed their remarks.
</p><p>
   During an aircraft check before a flight, FAA inspectors are not
required to check vital equipment, such as the landing gear and
engine, said Raymond J. DeCarli, an assistant inspector general for
the US Department of Transportation. ``Can you imagine taking your
car in for an inspection and having the brakes and tires checked 50
percent of the time?'' he asked. ``There's no checklist of what
they have to inspect.'' An inspector ``can do virtually nothing and
it's considered an inspection.''
</p><p>
   DeCarli's spoke as some congressional lawmakers called for more
scrutiny of FAA inspection procedures and questioned whether the
agency is too cozy with the industry it is assigned to watch. The
inspector general's office also said it would investigate reports,
first aired by ABC News, that the FAA encouraged inspectors to ``go
soft'' on ValuJet.
</p><p>
   Lawmakers said the various investigations of ValuJet and the FAA
would bring new urgency to a debate over the FAA's structure and
funding. Some critics want to strip the FAA of its mission of
promoting the US air travel industry, saying it cannot nurture
young airlines or aircraft manufacturers and ensure safety at the
same time.
</p><p>
   DeCarli's comments, made in a phone interview, echoed his
testimony before a Senate subcommittee April 30, in which he said
that training, personnel-testing and other FAA procedures were
inadequate.
</p><p>
   For example, DeCarli said the FAA failed to crack down on the
use of unapproved parts in airplane repair. Moreover, a study by
his office showed that FAA workers checked landing gear in only 48
percent of their preflight plane inspections. They checked the
engines 52 percent of the time and engine controls a third of the
time.
</p><p>
   DeCarli's report was one basis for a Newsweek magazine essay by
Mary Fackler Schiavo, inspector general for Transportation, in
which she said she has skipped conferences rather than fly on
``marginal airlines.'' She said she avoids flying on ValuJet
because of a history of ``mishaps.''
</p><p>
   Those comments alarmed lawmakers Tuesday.
</p><p>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, called it ``troubling''
and ``bizarre situation when the inspector general says they don't
feel comfortable flying an airline that is out flying planes and
offering its services to the American public.''
</p><p>
   At a Senate hearing on the FAA, scheduled long before the
ValuJet crash, other lawmakers said they were hesitant to comment
on FAA procedures without knowing the cause of the accident. Sen.
Ted Stevens, a Republican from Alaska, criticized Schiavo for
``destroying confidence'' in air safety. ``I suggest the president
has the right to remove an inspector general for dereliction of
duty,'' Stevens said.
</p><p>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said there was no talk of
removing Schiavo from her job.
</p><p>
   At the Senate Transportation Committee hearing, top FAA
officials said they would take three steps to improve safety:
</p><p>
    A;N;D;MD; Speed the hiring of 91 inspectors by the end of June who were
due to be hired by October. The agency has already hired 140
inspectors this year and has asked Congress for 150 more in its
next budget. It has about 2,500 inspectors.
</p><p>
    A;N;D;MD;  Speeding up introduction of a system that tracks inspection
data and flags dangerous conditions.
</p><p>
    A;N;D;MD;  Reviewing the work that inspectors do to make sure they focus
on top priorities.
</p><p>
   Separately, the FAA issued an emergency order Monday suspending
flight operations of HCL Aviation Inc.'s AvAtlantic because of
``discrepancies in the training, testing and qualifications of
flight attendants.'' AvAtlantic, based in Savannah, Ga., leases
planes to the presidential campaign of Sen. Bob Dole, which said it
expects no interruption in Dole's travel schedule.
</p><p>
   Even before the ValuJet crash, lawmakers had been wrestling with
how to improve the FAA. Plans to change the FAA's dual mission
could generate the biggest debate in the next few months.
</p><p>
   As part of the Clinton administration's efforts to boost US
exports, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and FAA
administrator David Hinson have traveled overseas to help sell
US-made airplanes. But the FAA is also charged with making sure
those planes are safe.
</p><p>
   ``There is an inherent conflict in those two missions,'' said
Sen. William S. Cohen, a Maine Republican.
</p><p>
   Hinson, the FAA administrator, said Tuesday that the air system
is safe and improving. If the United States had the same accident
rate today as in 1960, he said, a fatal air crash would occur every
10 days. ``When we say an airline is safe to fly, it is safe to
fly,'' he said. ''There is no gray area.''
</p><p>
   At the same time, though, the FAA budget of $8.6 billion is down
$600 million from 1993, and the FAA has lost 5,100 workers, a cut
of about 10 percent. Anthony J. Broderick, associate administrator
of the FAA, said Tuesday that the level of worker training has
decreased significantly, ``and quite frankly, I think it's too deep
a decrease.'' The agency has requested a 6 percent increase in its
training budget for next year.
</p><p>
   Complicating matters, the agency has lost $550 million in
monthly revenue because Congress, amid the impasse over the federal
budget, has not renewed a 20-year-old tax on airplane tickets and
cargo. Plans to revive the tax are tangled in a debate over the
FAA's structure and a controversial plan to replace the tax with
user fees to be paid by airlines. Several big airlines favor user
fees, but low-fare carriers say it would force them to raise
prices.

NERVOUS FLYERS HAS MANY PLACES TO FIND OUT INFORMATION ON AIRLINE
FLIGHTS, PLANES

<p>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  A;N;D;MD;  ``I'm traveling next week on a Delta
flight with an extemely fearful flier,'' begins the note posted
Saturday night in a computer forum on aviation safety.
</p><p>
   ``The ticket agent told me it was an MD-88 and I was hoping
someone here could provide us with a little info about exactly what
kind of aircraft that is and what its track record has been.''
</p><p>
   Relax, about two dozen people have since told the writer: the
planes have an outstanding safety record.
</p><p>
   ``Tell your friend to expect Delta to provide her with a safe
and on-time journey,'' one wrote.
</p><p>
   Places like CompuServe's Aviation Safety Interest Group, a
longtime gathering point for pilots and aviation buffs  A;N;D;MD;  and
several sites on the Internet  A;N;D;MD;  can arm you with a lot of
information about airplane models, crash records and other data.
</p><p>
   But can you find out if the plane you're catching tomorrow has
had a lot of maintenance problems? Or whether it's one of the
models for which the government, eager to prevent smoky fires, has
started requiring new cockpit wiring?
</p><p>
   A phone call to the airline can get you the model scheduled for
your flight and perhaps the age of the plane, but not much else.
</p><p>
   Even if you can extract the plane's tail number from a customer
service agent, searching aviation databases ``is not for someone
who doesn't have a lot of patience,'' said Mike Overly (CQ) ,
research director for the Aviation Safety Institute in Columbus,
Ohio.
</p><p>
   And once you had the records and are reassured your plane's in
fine shape, you could find the airline had to make a substitution.
</p><p>
   A USAir spokesman said a daily flight from West Palm Beach to
Charlotte, for example, could get any of the airline's 34 757s,
depending on weather delays, scheduled maintenance and other
factors.
</p><p>
   ``The airline usually will fly the same type of plane,'' said
Steve Loucks, spokesman for the American Society of Travel Agents.
``But there's no real way to pinpoint which piece of aircraft
you'll be traveling on.''
</p><p>
   If you're seeking information on the model, as the woman curious
about the MD-88 was, several sites on the World Wide Web can help.
</p><p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is a good starting point,
with the FAA's weekly summary of airport and airline incidents,
known as service difficulty reports, and equipment notices called
airworthiness directives.
</p><p>
   And Internet news groups and aviation forums such as
CompuServe's can offer useful advice, such as thinking of
turbulence ``like the wake from a boat'' and comparing changes in
engine pitch with the sounds a Greyhound bus moter makes while
climbing and descending hills.

INVESTIGATORS BEGIN EXAMINING DATA FROM VALUJET'S `BLACK BOX'
(With FLA-AIRCRASH-SAFETY, FLA-AIRCRASH-SEARCH)

c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MIAMI  A;N;D;MD;  Crash investigators on Tuesday began analyzing technical
information from the single ``black box'' recovered so far from the
Valujet DC-9 that crashed near here on Saturday and began
reassembling parts of the plane in a hangar at a small airport
nearby.
</p><p>
   Investigators are still searching for the second black box. In
addition, they are trying to figure out how to pull the wreckage
from the main crater the plane made in the mud under the shallow
water of the Everglades. They met here on Tuesday to work on that
problem with the Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Navy, Florida
officials and private engineering companies. The crater is about
130 feet long and 40 to 50 feet wide; no one knows its depth.
</p><p>
   In Washington the secretary of transportation, Federico Pena,
reported to President Clinton on steps the Federal Aviation
Administration would take ``to insure that the nation's civil
aviation system remains the safest in the world.''
</p><p>
   He said the FAA would accelerate an existing plan to hire more
inspectors and would work harder to track the status of problems
its inspectors uncover. For years the agency has been criticized by
auditors from the Transportation Department and Congress for what
they call sloppy record keeping that makes it harder to spot
dangerous trends and for the agency's inspection procedures.
</p><p>
   But whether the steps Pena discussed would have prevented the
crash is unclear because no one yet knows why the cockpit and cabin
filled with smoke and the plane crashed, killing all 109 people
aboard.
</p><p>
   At the crash scene, about 12 miles west of the Miami
metropolitan area, the searchers have been working
shoulder-to-shoulder in a carefully organized grid. Dressed in
special protective suits and slogging through several feet of water
and subsurface muck, they have been able to work only 20 to 30
minutes at a time in the 90-degree weather before coming out to
rest, cool off and be decontaminated from the jet fuel and possible
pathogens in the human remains in the water.
</p><p>
   Robert Francis, the vice chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said at a mid-day briefing that most of the plane
parts found had originally been in the tail of the jet, but, like
the human remains, had been discovered south of the main crater,
farther along the route of flight. The tail is where both of the
black boxes were situated.
</p><p>
   The box that has been found was the flight-data recorder, which
collects information on altitude, heading, speed, horizontal and
vertical acceleration and engine function. Francis said that the
box was dented but that its magnetic tapes had recorded ``good
data.''
</p><p>
   But the box will not provide information on many individual
parts of the plane, and reading its information will be a little
like watching an opera in a foreign language, providing only a
gross approximation of what happened.
</p><p>
   On the other hand, the other box, the cockpit voice recorder,
could contain ``a magic bullet,'' a statement by the captain or
first officer that would make clear what happened, said one safety
board official. People at the safety board said they could not
remember a case in which one box had been recovered but the other
had not.
</p><p>
   Francis also spoke about the reassembly of the plane in a hangar
nearby. In crash investigations, engineers often lay out on the
floor of a hangar the mechanical pieces of the plane they recover.
This helps them keep track of what has been found, what is missing
and how the plane has been damaged. In this inquiry, not enough
parts have yet been found to draw conclusions, Francis said.
</p><p>
   Of the aircraft parts found so far, none shows obvious signs of
fire or smoke, searchers said. The co-pilot of the plane reported
smoke in the cockpit and cabin shortly before the crash.
</p><p>
   Searchers have not found the air-conditioning packs, which are
devices powered by the jet engines that pressurize air for the
cabin and are one possible source of smoke. But there are many
other potential sources of smoke, experts say, including electrical
wiring. Francis said some wiring had been found and would be
closely scrutinized.
</p><p>
   Wiring in old planes like this one, built in 1969, has long been
a concern, and in Washington, the FAA said on Tuesday that a new
rule would take effect on Wednesday to require that DC-9's and
other planes made by the McDonnell Douglas Corp. be inspected for
chafed wiring in the cockpit. On some planes, but not DC-9's, that
condition has caused smoke.
</p><p>
   As salvage operations proceed, investigators will also be
looking for circuit breakers for the fuel pumps. A malfunction in
these circuit breakers caused a lengthy delay in Atlanta, before
the plane took off for Miami in its last successful flight. There
is no immediate indication that this problem had any relationship
to the crash when it took off for the return trip to Atlanta.
</p><p>
   The FAA on Tuesday continued to defer questions on the crash to
the safety board, an independent agency that takes charge of plane
accident investigations. The crash is a blow for the aviation
administration, which early this year identified Valujet as
requiring additional attention and blitzed the young airline with
hundreds of inspections in a one-week period in February. FAA
officials say they found no violations significant enough to
require enforcement action, but they did make numerous suggestions,
to which, they said, the airline voluntarily responded.
</p><p>
   Mary Schiavo, the inspector general of the Department of
Transportation, which is the parent agency of the FAA, said today
that she would look into whether the investigators had been too
easy on the airline.

U.S. AIRLINE REGULATOR ANNOUNCES `INTENSIVE' REVIEW OF VALUJET
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By Jeff Vinson
c.1996 Bloomberg Business News
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Aviation
Administration said it is launching an ``intensive 30-day review''
of ValuJet Airlines operations following the crash of the discount
airline's Flight 592 Saturday in the Everglades, which killed 109
people.
</p><p>
   FAA administrator David Hinson, who announced the review at a
news conference this morning, said the agency still considers
ValuJet ``safe to fly.''
</p><p>
   ``The additional inspections we are doing are additional safety
margins and should be viewed as such.''
</p><p>
   Tony Broderick, the FAA's associate administrator for regulation
and certification, said the review would involve ``five specific
steps'' in which the agency would:
</p><p>
   -- Review all reports of mechanical problems filed within the
past 12 months to insure they have been corrected.
</p><p>
   -- Inspect all aircraft the morning after they have undergone
overnight repairs.
</p><p>
   -- Put FAA inspectors on every ValuJet plane for weekly
in-flight inspections. ValuJet has ``at least 350 flights weekly
and we'd like them on as many as possible,'' Broderick said of the
FAA inspectors.
</p><p>
   -- Reinspect all of ValuJet's maintenance stations at operations
centers away from the airline's main repair facilities.
</p><p>
   -- Conduct ``top to bottom inspections'' of every ValuJet plane
that has undergone heavy maintenance.
</p><p>
   ValuJet Flight 592 crashed as the pilot and first officer were
attempting an emergency landing of the 27-year-old, McDonnell
Douglas-built DC-9 jetliner back to Mi
</p><p>
   QIreporting smoke in the cockpit and passenger cabin.
</p><p>
   Last night, the National Transportation Safety Board, which is
directing the accident investigation, said an explosion could have
torn through the jetliner, triggering a sudden loss of speed and
altitude.
</p><p>
   A flight recorder recovered by police divers Monday indicated
the DC-9 had a flight ``anomaly'' 3 1/2 minutes before the crash,
Robert Francis, NTSB vice chairman, said in Miami.
</p><p>
   Additionally, two parts of the plane were discovered, marked
with ``apparent soot,'' and that suggested ``there could have been
an explosion,'' Francis said.
</p><p>
   While no cause has been pinpointed, accident investigators were
studying the possibility that the blast may have been related to
50-60 surplus aircraft oxygen generators shipped in the aircraft's
cargo hold.
</p><p>
   The generators, which had exceeded their shelf life, were being
shipped to ValuJet's headquarters in Atlanta.
</p><p>
   It wasn't immediately clear last night whether shipping the
generators was contrary to government regulations.
</p><p>
   Hinson declined to answer a question on that point, although he
did say that ``some hazardous material is allowed on airplanes
under proper circumstances.''
</p><p>
   In trading today, ValuJet shares were at 14 5/8, down 3/8.
Shares had fallen as much as 27 percent on Monday, the first
trading session after the crash, to 11 3/4.
</p><p>
   Following the crash, the FAA expanded a 120-day investigation of
ValuJet's flight operations, training and maintenance procedures.
The inquiry was prompted by several mishaps, including a fire last
year that destroyed a ValuJet DC-9 on a runway in Atlanta and
injured several people.
</p><p>
   The airline has one of the oldest jet fleets in the sky, and has
drawn criticism from the inspector general of the Transportation
Department, Mary Schiavo. However, ValuJet President Lewis Jordan
has defended the airline's safety standards, saying: ``We cannot
put too much emphasis on safety --ever.''

1986 COMMERCIAL FLIGHT EXPERIENCED SIMILAR FIRE, EXPLOSION TO
VALUJET PLANE
EDs: With CRASH-MAIN.
By SIOBHAN MORRISSEY
c.1996 Cox News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  A;N;D;MD;  Half an hour after a mechanic jostled an
oxygen-generating canister aboard a grounded McDonnell Douglas
DC-10, the airplane began smoldering and then erupted into flames.
</p><p>
   Although no one was injured, flames destroyed the American Trans
Air jetliner shortly after it arrived from Honolulu on Aug. 10,
1986. A decade later, National Transportation Safety Board
investigators are exploring whether a similar fire could have
caused ValuJet 592 to crash into the Everglades, killing all 110
(CQ) people on board.
</p><p>
   ValuJet's cargo manifest listed five crates containing 50 to 60
of the stainless steel canisters that produce oxygen for emergency
masks. The devices were stowed near three inflated aircraft spare
tires.
</p><p>
   Robert Francis, the board's vice chairman, said the oxygen
generators may have exploded in the forward cargo hold.
</p><p>
   Such an explosion could account for why the air speed and
altimeter registered information that conflicted with radar reports
of how fast and how high the plane was traveling, chief
investigator Gregory Feith said.
</p><p>
   Similarly, the aircraft tires pose a potential problem for
in-air explosion. Former safety board chairman Jim Burnett
described the aircraft tires as ``very dangerous to be around
because they are under very high pressure  A;N;D;MD;  if you are around one
when it blows it can kill you.''
</p><p>
   Sometimes tires that are part of the landing gear explode while
in flight but they do not damage the aircraft because a special
shield in the wheel well protects the aircraft, Burnett said.
However, the cargo hold lacks such shielding, he said.
</p><p>
   ``I've heard of tires exploding in the wheel well, but never ran
across the issue of them being transported in the cargo,'' he said.
``I rather suspect that's because they don't do it.''
</p><p>
   Other safety board officials registered concern about proper use
of oxygen generating systems as early as 1976.
</p><p>
   ``The potential for serious injuries and fatalities is great,''
an NTSB report said then, noting recurring problems with the
systems that chemically generate oxygen on DC-10s and Lockheed
1011s.
</p><p>
   The Department of Transportation classifies the oxygen
generators as hazardous materials when carried as company material
in cargo compartments. They should be packaged and stowed securely.
</p><p>
   Just as in the ValuJet case, oxygen generators were stowed in
the forward cargo compartment of the American Trans Air plane what
was demolished in the Chicago fire 10 years ago. An American Trans
Air mechanic apparently set off the fire that destroyed the DC-10
while attempting to fix an oxygen compartment door that would not
close.
</p><p>
   ``He found a loose oxygen canister and handled it improperly by
its oxygen hose,'' according to a safety board account of the fire.
That released the firing pin, which in turn fired the percussion
cap and triggered a chemical reaction that generated oxygen.
</p><p>
   Improper handling of the oxygen generating canisters -- such as
inadvertently releasing the firing pin -- can trigger a chemical
reaction and generate oxygen, which generates heat up to 430
degrees outside the canister. That's hot enough to explode hydrogen
and automatically inflate air bags in vehicle fires. Volcanic
eruptions that throw off ash and steam reach just over 400 degrees.
</p><p>
   The fire aboard American Trans Air began shortly after the
aircraft completed a flight from Honolulu. The passengers and crew
had deplaned the cleaning crew entered, noting the cabin was
initially cold and grew ``uncomfortably hot'' within minutes.
Within the next 30 minutes gray smoke began billowing in the
passenger cabin, forcing the cleaning crew to evacuate.
</p><p>
   ``The smoke grew darker and rapidly intensified,'' according to
a safety board account of the fire.
</p><p>
   The cabin then burst into fire, destroying the entire aircraft.
The fire ignited seat covers, burned through the cabin floor and
spread throughout the entire cabin.
</p><p>
   After the fire investigators tested a similar oxygen canister to
determine whether it could generate enough heat to cause the fire.
They wrapped the canister in a paper laboratory coat and pulled the
canister's pin. The coat ignited and burned.

<p>
   MIAMI  A;N;D;MD;  Valujet Flight 592, which crashed here on Saturday
apparently after an explosion and fire on board, may have been
carrying highly reactive chemicals because an inexperienced
shipping clerk did not recognize them as hazardous materials,
according to people involved in the investigation.
</p><p>
   The chemicals were in canisters called oxygen generators, which
are used to supply emergency masks with oxygen. A maintenance
contractor had removed the canisters from another Valujet plane at
the airline's request and delivered them back to Valujet. An
employee of the contractor packed the canisters in boxes and
labeled the boxes ``empty,'' a notation that ordinarily would refer
to the canisters, not the boxes.
</p><p>
   Investigators now believe that the canisters may have been full
and consider them a leading suspect in the crash. Even if the
canisters were empty, they still might have required more secure
packaging, according to aviation experts.
</p><p>
   Kenneth P. Quinn, a spokesman for the maintenance contractor,
SabreTech, said: ``It is unclear whether the employee knew that the
substance in the canisters constituted a hazardous material, and if
so, whether the material had been discharged.''
</p><p>
   Quinn said that the cannisters, 50 to 60 in all, in five
cardboard boxes, ``were returned to Valujet for appropriate
disposal.'' He said a shipping tag on the boxes had two notations:
``empty'' and ``customer furnished material returned per customer
instructions.'' Quinn said his company was now investigating
whether the canisters were still full.
</p><p>
   It is standard practice in the industry for such canisters, when
carried as cargo, to be emptied and packed in strong, airtight
boxes.
</p><p>
   The chief accident investigator, Gregory Feith, said at a
mid-day briefing near the scene of the accident: ``We don't know
what experience the people that were handling these canisters
had.'' He added: ``If you pick up a one pound canister and somebody
says they're off an airplane, they're old, that may have been
interpreted by some to mean something else.''
</p><p>
   He said: ``There's a terminology problem here that we need to
clarify.''
</p><p>
   Feith added: ``We're going to try to identify who actually
handled it, what they saw, what they used to make the evaluation as
to whether they are actually full or not full.''
</p><p>
   The canisters are not used on DC-9s, the kind of the plane that
crashed. They are used on MD-80s, which Valujet also flies, to make
oxygen for passenger emergency masks. They make oxygen with a
chemical reaction that generates tremendous heat but is safe when
the canisters are installed in a seatback or overhead compartment.
</p><p>
   The National Transportation Safety Board has found strong
evidence of fire and explosion on the plane, and has found
paperwork on the ground indicating that the oxygen generators were
on board. It has not suggested a mechanism by which a generator or
generators became activated, though, and it is still looking at
wiring and other possible sources of explosion or fire.
</p><p>
   SabreTech said in a statement on Thursday: ``We agree with Lewis
Jordan, president of Valujet, that it is premature and
irresponsible to engage in speculation over the probable cause of
this tragic accident. We are cooperating fully with the FAA and
NTSB.''
</p><p>
   Thus far, none of the generators has been recovered. The safety
board hopes to find some in the muck of the Everglades where the
plane crashed and check their serial numbers against maintenance
records to determine definitively if they were still potent when
shipped.
</p><p>
   Also on Thursday, Feith contradicted the Federal Aviation
Administration and said that Valujet could legally have carried the
generators even though it has chosen not to carry hazardous
materials for others and has not developed the procedures and
trained the personnel as required by the FAA for such work.
</p><p>
   On Wednesday, senior officials of the FAA, who refused to be
publicly named, said that if the airline was not authorized to
handle hazardous materials, then it could not carry the oxygen
generators even if they were what the industry calls ``company
materials.''
</p><p>
   Feith said: ``There are provisions that allow Valujet to ship
hazardous material that is necessary for company business.'' He
said: ``This discussion needs to be expanded to find out if in fact
this was being done for company business, and then what regulations
and requirements does Valujet have to follow when shipping
hazardous materials for their own benefit.''
</p><p>
   Investigators have recovered the flight data recorder, one of
the plane's ``black boxes,'' and found signs on it consistent with
an explosion on board. They have also found soot-covered wreckage.
In addition, before the plane crashed, the co-pilot reported to the
ground that the cockpit and cabin were filling with smoke. A
possible source of that smoke, according to investigators, was
three aircraft tires from an MD-80, carried with the generators in
the forward cargo compartment.
</p><p>
   On Thursday, searchers used a heavy-duty helicopter to lift
major pieces of the wreckage out of the Everglades, including two
tires, two major landing gear pieces, some pieces of wing and
fuselage, and ``a piece that looks like it's from the rear cargo
bay,'' said Robert Francis, vice chairman of the safety board.
Investigators are not sure whether the tires were cargo or in use
on the plane. Searchers have also recovered both engines, Francis
said.
</p><p>
   Illustrating the difficulty of recovery, he said that the
helicopter pulled at one engine with a force of 4,000 pounds before
freeing it from the muck; once airborne, it weighed less than
3,000, he said.
</p><p>
   For the last two days, Francis has been wearing a small green
ribbon marked ``Valujet Flight 592, May 11, 1996.'' The ribbons
were given to dozens of relatives of the victims who have arrived
here to await recovery of body parts.
</p><p>
   Searchers have not found the cockpit voice recorder, which
investigators badly want.
</p><p>
   Support organizations, including the Salvation Army and the Fire
Department, plan now to be at the scene at least three to four more
weeks; the Salvation Army said it was serving about 1,800 meals a
day.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  Federal crash investigators said Sunday that they
had found a partly burned aircraft tire that was carried as cargo
by the Valujet DC-9 that crashed near Miami on May 11, a likely
source of the smoke that the co-pilot urgently reported just before
the crash. Embedded in the tire, the investigators said, were parts
from at least one oxygen generator, a device that can generate
tremendous heat.
</p><p>
   The discovery adds substantial weight to a leading theory in the
crash, that one or more generators, which were being carried as
cargo on the flight, somehow activated and ignited the tire.
</p><p>
   But the National Transportation Safety Board, following its
standard practice, will take months before it formally establishes
what caused the crash, which killed all 110 people aboard when it
slammed into the Everglades a few minutes after takeoff from Miami
International Airport, bound for Atlanta.
</p><p>
   The investigator in charge, Gregory Feith, said at a briefing
near the crash site that the safety board's staff had determined
through interviews of ground personnel that there were 119 of the
generators on board, double what had previously been suspected, and
that some were stacked on top of one of three tires in the forward
cargo hold.
</p><p>
   He said the generators, which are each a little bigger than a
coffee thermos, were in cardboard boxes. When carried as cargo they
are supposed to be in air-tight containers, and standard airline
practice is to transport them only after they have been activated
and allowed to run through their chemical reaction, thus
eliminating the possibility that they will produce heat, which can
start fires, and oxygen, which feeds fires, while in a cargo hold.
</p><p>
   But there is strong suspicion that at least some of the
generators were still potent. They had been removed three months
earlier from three other Valujet aircraft, MD-80s being refurbished
for Valujet, and were being returned to the airline by a
maintenance contractor.
</p><p>
   On MD-80s the generators are used to provide oxygen to passenger
emergency masks, but because the chemicals they use can
deteriorate, each is given an expiration date, and these had
expired.
</p><p>
   Feith said Sunday that Valujet personnel put them aboard the
DC-9 for shipment to Atlanta, where the airline has its
headquarters. The distinction may be important because Sabertech,
the maintenance contractor, contends that whether or not the
generators were hazardous cargo, the airline is responsible for
figuring out what it is loading on its planes.
</p><p>
   Valujet officials assert that before the airline put the boxes
aboard the flight, 592, its personnel saw that the labels on the
boxes described the generators as empty.
</p><p>
   Valujet and Sabertech have already begun pointing fingers at
each other, and may eventually do so in court. While the safety
board does not fix blame for accidents, Feith has repeatedly used a
legal term in describing one of the chief areas of inquiry: what
the board wants to know about the oxygen generators, he said, is
the ``chain of custody.''
</p><p>
   The investigators have a lot of other work to do. Many
soot-covered parts have been discovered, and laboratory technicians
will examine the soot to see if it is from rubber or from
electrical wiring, which is another suspect in the crash.
</p><p>
   Feith said that the oxygen generators and the tires were ``a
main focus'' of the investigation, but that it was still too soon
to draw conclusions. ``We have 90 percent of an airplane that is
unaccountable,'' he said, noting that most of it is still under
water or buried in mud.
</p><p>
   Most of the plane's parts have been found by police officers
wading through the area or by pairs of searchers who lash two
airboats together, about three feet apart, and reach down between
them with their hands, pulling up whatever they find.
</p><p>
   Investigators have begun using special radar that can see
through the mud, and hope to find the cockpit voice recorder.
</p><p>
   To look at the main crater dug by the plane when it crashed,
they recently received special diving suits that are designed for
use with hazardous materials. But then they found that the airboats
from which they have been working are too small to carry all the
required diving equipment. The investigators hope to begin the
dives on Tuesday morning.
</p><p>
   Feith said that investigators had finished reviewing the
maintenance records of the plane and that ``the paperwork was in
order from what they could see.''

SABRETECH SAYS IT DELIVERED MISLABELED BOX TO VALUJET (REPEAT)
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By Jeff Vinson
c.1996 Bloomberg Business News
   (Repeats story that moved late yesterday; adds comments from
Quinn in paragraphs 3-4)
Atlanta, May 20 (Bloomberg) -- SabreTech has opened an ``exhaustive
investigation'' into why its employees delivered to ValuJet Inc. a
box of oxygen generators marked as ``empty,'' said a spokesman for
the Miami aircraft repair facility.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ``We acknowledge that SabreTech delivered to ValuJet boxes
containing the canisters with a shipping ticket marked as`empty',''
said Dave Reddick, a spokesman for shipper's parent company.
``We're certainly concerned about this.''
</p><p>
   Kenneth P. Quinn, a SabreTech spokesman in Miami, said late
yesterday that his company, ``consistent with past practice,''
returned ValuJet materials to the airline for ``appropriate
disposal.''
</p><p>
   ``ValuJet made an independent decision to ship their company
materials on board an aircraft, and apparently did not ensure that
they were properly labeled, packaged and stored,'' Quinn said.
</p><p>
   ValuJet officials said the airline wasn't informed that cargo
flight 592 was hazardous.
</p><p>
   Hazardous materials experts investigating the May 11 crash of
the discount carrier's DC-9 in Florida's Everglades earlier this
month found evidence that exploding oxygen canisters in the cargo
hold may have caused the accident, which killed 110 people.
</p><p>
   The National Transportation Safety Board reported that divers
found metal fragments from oxygen canisters that apparently
exploded and burned before the plane crashed. Five boxes of oxygen
generators were presented for shipment to Atlanta from Miami by
non-ValuJet employees, and someone filled out the ticket to read:
``5 boxes, oxy canisters empty,'' ValuJet said in a statement. The
shipment was delivered to ValuJet in boxes without the federally
required hazardous material labeling or any other indication of the
hazardous goods within, ValuJet said. SabreTech removed the expired
canisters from three ValuJet MD-80 aircraft, the NTSB said. Two or
three months later, a SabreTech official ordered them returned to
ValuJet. Consistent with ValuJet's statement, NTSB lead
investigator Gregory Feith said the boxes were marked as company
material, the shipping manifest said the canisters were ``empty.''
</p><p>
   About 119 oxygen canisters were in the cargo hold, more than
double the amount originally thought, Feith said. No plastic safety
caps were used to cover the firing mechanisms on the canisters, he
said. ``We're cooperating fully with the NTSB, the FAA and
Department'' to find out why the box was mislabeled, Reddick said.
</p><p>
   Sabreliner, a St. Louis-based company that specializes in engine
overhaul and structural modification of government and civilian
aircraft, purchased SabreTech, formerly known as DynAire, last
year, Reddick said. He said this is the first time an incident like
this has happened at SabreTech. ``We are very proud of our very
good safety record, and we're doing everything possible to check to
see that the proper procedures are followed,'' Reddick said. On
Sunday, ValuJet President Lewis Jordan ask Americans to wait for
the results of the federal probe before abandoning the troubled
airline.
</p><p>
   ``We think it would be a tragedy for the American people who
can't afford high fares to not have ValuJet around,'' Jordan on ABC
TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley.'' ValuJet, based in Atlanta,
cut its number of daily flights in half during a special Federal
Aviation Administration safety inspection of its 51 planes. The FAA
has launched an ``intensive review'' of the airline, which follows
a special 120-day investigation that started last February after a
string of safety-related incidents.
</p><p>
   In trading today, ValuJet shares closed at 11 1/4, down 1 7/8,
the most active issue. ValuJet shares have fallen more than 27
percent since the crash.

VALUJET SHARES RISE AS SABRETECH ADMITS MISLABELING (CORRECT)
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<p>
   Atlanta, May 21 (Bloomberg) -- ValuJet Inc. shares ended a
five-day slide after an aircraft maintenance company said it
mislabeled as empty a box of oxygen generators that may have caused
last week's plane crash that killed 110.
</p><p>
   Shares in the no-frills airline rose 1 7/8, or 17 percent, to 13
1/8 in trading of 6.8 million shares, making it the fifth
most-active U.S. stock.
</p><p>
   Despite the rebound, Valujet shares are still down 27 percent
from May 10, the day before Flight 592 crashed in the Florida
Everglades.
</p><p>
   The maintenance company's admission won't completely repair
ValuJet's reputation with travelers, investors and analysts said.
</p><p>
   ``ValuJet's got to convince the public that its 27-year-old
planes are OK to fly,'' said John Cabell, co-manager of the USAA
Aggressive Growth Fund, which owns 150,000 shares of the airline's
stock. ``There's still a nagging credibility problem.''
</p><p>
   Attorneys also said the admission by Miami-based SabreTech, the
aircraft maintenance firm, doesn't eliminate ValuJet's legal
liability in the crash.
</p><p>
   ValuJet bonds traded as high as 85 cents on the dollar today,
little changed from yesterday's close of 85.25.
</p><p>
   ValuJet also acknowledged today that co-founder Timothy Flynn
sold 25 percent of his stake in the airline nine days after the
ValuJet crash to satisfy a margin call.
</p><p>
   SabreTech, a unit of closely held Sabreliner Corp. of St. Louis,
said yesterday that five boxes containing 119 oxygen generators
were delivered to Atlanta-based ValuJet without federally required
labels identifying them as hazardous.
</p><p>
   Investigators found evidence that an explosion of one or more of
the canisters in the plane's cargo hold may have triggered the
crash.
</p><p>
   Showing that the canisters were mislabeled isn't enough to
convince consumers that the airline is safe, analysts said.
</p><p>
   ``That's just one issue out of many that has been raised about
ValuJet since the crash,'' said Vivian Lee, an analyst at BT
Securities. ``Until there are more definitive answers, it's too
soon to guess about the company's future.''
</p><p>
   ValuJet has spent most of the year under intense regulatory
scrutiny after the airline had five minor accidents, including a
fire in one plane. Its planes had 11 serious mechanical problems
that disrupted flights in the last two years.
</p><p>
   Also, it has been widely reported since the crash that ValuJet
has the oldest fleet of any U.S. airline. Avitas Inc., a consulting
firm, says ValuJet's planes average 26.4 years old. Kiwi
International Airlines has the second-oldest fleet with jets
averaging 22.8 years.
</p><p>
   The ValuJet DC-9 that crashed was 27 years old.
</p><p>
   ValuJet's liability in connection with the crash is likely to be
diminished, but not eliminated by SabreTech's admission, attorneys
said.
</p><p>
   ``This won't get ValuJet off the hook, but it may give them a
co-defendant,'' said Lee Kreindler of Kreindler A;N;D;AMP; Kreindler in New
York, whose firm represents plaintiffs in airline crash cases.
</p><p>
   ValuJet was obligated to open the crate of oxygen canisters and
inspect at least some to determine whether they were empty, said
William Wimsatt, a partner at Los Angeles-based Magana, Cathcart A;N;D;AMP;
McCarthy, a law firm specializing in aviation law.
</p><p>
   ``It certainly could be expected that ValuJet wouldn't rely on
what someone told them about a potentially hazardous product that
would be put on their airplane,'' Wimsatt said.
</p><p>
   ValuJet has $750 million liability insurance to cover the crash.
</p><p>
   Oxygen generators, if full, are considered hazardous materials
and aren't supposed to be shipped aboard commercial flights, the
Federal Aviation Administration has said.
</p><p>
   ``We acknowledge that SabreTech delivered to ValuJet boxes
containing the canisters with a shipping ticket marked as
`empty','' Dave Reddick, a spokesman for the maintenance company's
parent. ``We're certainly concerned about this.''
</p><p>
   Still, SabreTech said it doesn't accept responsibility for the
crash.
</p><p>
   ``ValuJet made an independent decision to ship their company
materials on board an aircraft, and apparently did not ensure that
they were properly labeled, packaged and stored,'' said Kenneth P.
Quinn, a SabreTech spokesman.
</p><p>
   Standard A;N;D;AMP; Poor's said it's considering lowering the rating of
SabreLiner's bonds.
</p><p>
   ValuJet co-founder Timothy Flynn sold 25 percent of his stake in
the airline nine days after the ValuJet crash.
</p><p>
   Flynn, one of four founders of the Atlanta-based airline and a
board member, sold 1.5 million shares yesterday, raising $16.9
million. Flynn still owns 4.5 million shares.
</p><p>
   Flynn sold the shares to satisfy a margin call, said Gregg
Kenyon, ValuJet spokesman. Kenyon declined to say how much margin
debt was owed.
</p><p>
   A margin call is a broker's demand for additional cash or
securities so that an investor can continue to borrow from the
broker to buy securities.
</p><p>
   The shares Flynn sold -- worth $52 million in November --would
have been worth $19.5 million today, with the stock's rebound.
</p><p>
   ValuJet's stock isn't likely rebound to the upper teens, where
it traded before the crash, Steve Lewins an analyst at Gruntal A;N;D;AMP;
Co. in New York said.
</p><p>
   ``Probably because of all the publicity, it will take them a
year to grow out of this,'' Lewins said.

SMALL, LOW-FARE AIRLINES SHAKEN BY VALUJET CRASH
(See also VALUJET-CRASH)
(sw)
By ADAM BRYANT
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Mark McDonald has weathered almost every storm imaginable since
he started Nations Air last year. The small airline, which has
served Boston, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, was shut down for a
week last July by the Federal Aviation Administration for a
paperwork violation. A few months earlier, a bank pulled its
commitment at the last minute to lend him $1 million. A company
that leased him a plane took it back in the middle of the night
because of a mix-up.
</p><p>
   But his airline could not withstand the impact of the Valujet
Airlines crash 11 days ago.
</p><p>
   Nations Air is halting scheduled service and laying off a third
of its staff to go into the charter business, McDonald said. He was
forced to make the decision after he saw reservations drop, and
drop some more, after the Valujet crash because of travelers'
concerns about fledgling airlines like Valujet and Nations Air.
</p><p>
   When a plane crashes, the airline that operates it usually sees
cancellations and a drop in bookings for anywhere from a week to a
few months. But the Valujet crash on May 11 has raised concerns
among travelers who have been flying increasingly on smaller and
younger airlines, with names that are less well known than
American, United and Delta.
</p><p>
   Nations Air may be an extreme example, but some other low-fare,
smaller airlines said that bookings had dropped since the Valujet
crash, and many more said they were fielding questions from scores
of anxious travelers about the safety of their aircraft.
</p><p>
   Jet Train, an airline that started serving Orlando, Newark,
N.J., and Pittsburgh in January, said that although it has had few
cancellations, the number of its daily bookings dropped by 30
percent in the days immediately after the Valujet crash. It has
also received hundreds of calls from travelers asking questions
about the age of its fleet.
</p><p>
   ``Certainly we have been impacted,'' said Jim Davis, the
airline's president. ``But it appears to be returning to near
normal levels.''
</p><p>
   Other airlines like Tower Air, Reno Air and Kiwi Airlines said
that they had also received calls from passengers with questions
about their safety records and fleet age, but that they had seen
few cancellations. In fact, Kiwi, whose route network overlaps many
Valujet routes, has seen bookings rise by about 5 percent since the
crash.
</p><p>
   Southwest Airlines, another low-fare airline, said it had seen
no drop in bookings, and only sporadic safety-related questions
from its customers. Southwest is also better known than many
start-ups; it is the eighth-largest airline in the country, has
been in business 24 years and has never had a crash.
</p><p>
   McDonald, of Nations Air, said he felt blindsided. The day after
the Valujet crash, McDonald said his bookings dropped 28 percent.
On Monday, they dropped another 6 percent. As the week wore on,
they remained at 40 percent below earlier levels.
</p><p>
   Nations Air, which has never had an incident or accident, was
suddenly losing $100,000 a week with no certainty of when business
would bounce back. The airline had been hovering around break even.
It laid off 46 employees on Tuesday.
</p><p>
   ``We are not large enough to stand by and burn off that type of
money,'' said McDonald, who decided to start flying charter service
because it is a more reliable source of income, though it has less
potential for profits and rapid growth.
</p><p>
   ``There's been an erosion of consumer confidence in the industry
and you don't know how long it's going to last,'' he said.
</p><p>
   Until the Valujet crash, the public confidence in such airlines
appeared to have been high. Airlines were being started at a rate
not seen since immediately after the industry was deregulated in
1978. Since 1990, about 50 applications have been filed to start
new airlines, the Transportation Department said. It is a trend the
Transportation Department has applauded, stating recently that such
low-cost airlines saved consumers $6.3 billion a year. The FAA has
said that the Valujet crash was the first for a jet airline that
started after deregulation.
</p><p>
   Valujet has set the pace for the growth of such airlines,
expanding to 320 flights since it started in October 1993. It said
last Friday that it would cut its schedule in half.
</p><p>
   Officials of Valujet, which has been highly profitable, are
expected to talk on Wednesday with Wall Street analysts who follow
the airline industry about the effects of the crash on its
finances.
</p><p>
   The airline, an unusually strong performer in an industry where
profits have long been thin or nonexistent, has been as popular
with investors as it was with travelers, with its stock rising
quickly in anticipation of profitable growth.
</p><p>
   When the stock market opened on the Monday after the crash,
shares in Valujet that had been trading at $17.875 immediately lost
a third of their value. They have since rebounded somewhat, closing
on Tuesday at $13.125, up $1.875 from Monday's close.
</p><p>
   However, one investor who recently sold shares in Valujet was
also a founder of the airline. Timothy Flynn, one of four founders,
sold 1.5 million hares on Monday. But the airline said that Flynn
sold the stock to pay off money that he borrowed for investment
purposes. Valujet said that Flynn still owned 4.5 million shares of
the airline.

COUPLE RECALLS JET'S FLAWS BEFORE CRASH
(sw)
By ROBYN MEREDITH
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATLANTA  A;N;D;MD;  Just hours before Valujet Flight 592 crashed into the
swampy muck, Pamela Hettinger was sitting on the same DC-9, looking
out her window high above the Everglades and imagining a similar
fate, because she thought the plane was in trouble.
</p><p>
   She and her husband, Wayne Hettinger, were aboard the
27-year-old jet's next-to-last flight.
</p><p>
   On May 11, the morning of the crash, the Hettingers boarded
Valujet Flight 591 in Atlanta, bound for Miami. After a quiet
flight, the plane began its descent. Suddenly, she said, the cabin
lights went dark and the public address system failed. ``They had
to use a bullhorn to tell people to put their seatbelts back on,''
Mrs. Hettinger said. She remembers looking outside then with
visions of a plunge to her death.
</p><p>
   Within 10 minutes, Flight 591 had landed safely in Miami. But
Mrs. Hettinger, who flies four or five times a year and had flown
Valujet before without concern, said that she had tried to persuade
her husband to leave the plane with her even before they left
Atlanta.
</p><p>
   She became concerned, she said, after the airplane returned to
the gate twice before taking off. ``I know accidents happen, but I
just feel like that plane should have never left the ground,'' she
said in an interview on Tuesday. Hettinger echoed her account in a
separate interview.
</p><p>
   The Hettingers' recollections provide the first detailed public
description of the mechanical difficulties aboard the aircraft
hours before it crashed. While federal investigators are focusing
on the possibility that oxygen generators in the cargo hold caused
the crash, they have not ruled out other sources of the fire on
board, including wiring. Shortly after the crash, a Federal
Aviation Administration rule took effect requiring airlines that
fly DC-9's to check them for chafed wires in the cockpit.
</p><p>
   Other passengers on the Hettingers' flight could not be reached
for comment, and safety officials had few details about Flight 591.
A Valujet spokesman, Gregg Kenyon, also refused to discuss the
flight, saying, ``We are not able to talk about anything that
happened with aircraft 904'' after May 9.
</p><p>
   But Gregory Feith, the National Transportation Safety Board's
lead investigator for the crash that killed 110 people, gave a
brief account of Flight 591 at a press conference in Miami several
days after the crash.
</p><p>
   Before the jet took off from Atlanta ``there was a problem with
the circuit breakers'' for the fuel pumps, Feith said, adding: ``A
mechanic came on, thought that he had fixed it, and got off. The
problem had not been resolved and he got back on. The problem was
resolved and the aircraft departed.''
</p><p>
   Mrs. Hettinger recalled watching those events from her seat in
the second row of the aircraft in front of its left wing. After the
jet pulled back from its gate, she said, its lights went out, the
public address system stopped working and, moments later, the
engines clicked off. The plane restarted and returned to the gate,
she said.
</p><p>
   A mechanic boarded and went into the cockpit, then the cabin,
Mrs. Hettinger said. After he left, the plane again backed away
from the gate, Mrs. Hettinger recalled.
</p><p>
   Again, the cabin lights went dark and the public address system
failed. Flight 591 returned to its gate, and the mechanic
reappeared, stayed 15 minutes and left.
</p><p>
   ``The third time, we took off,'' Mrs. Hettinger said.
</p><p>
   The Hettingers learned after boarding a cruise ship in Miami
that the plane they had flown had crashed.
</p><p>
   ``That is when it made me a little weak-kneed,'' Hettinger said,
``because for the life of me I can't see why they ever left again,
with all that going on.''

VALUJET TAPE HOLDS WARNING OF FIRE TO THE PILOT
(HLW)
By MICHAEL WINES
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  The pilots of Valujet Flight 592 were some six
minutes into a routine flight out of Miami when someone apparently
burst through the cockpit door to warn of a fire in the passenger
cabin, according to investigators' first analysis of the tape from
the jet's battered cockpit voice recorder.
</p><p>
   ``There was also an indication from the cabin that there were
problems obtaining oxygen,'' Robert Francis, the vice-chairman of
the National Transportation Safety Board, said at a briefing on
Monday.
</p><p>
   Beyond that, Francis said, the first review of the recorder
disclosed little about the May 11 crash, which killed all 110 crew
members and passengers aboard the DC-9.
</p><p>
   Francis refused to speculate on the meanings of any of the
cockpit exchanges or to say whether the shortage of oxygen referred
to breathable air in the cabin or the functioning of the oxygen
masks that are supposed to drop automatically from above
passengers' seats in emergencies.
</p><p>
   He said that he had not personally listened to the recording but
that he had been told that it was extraordinarily difficult to
decipher and yielded little else on its first playing.
</p><p>
   ``At this stage, we have not had the opportunity to do enough
work on the tape to say how much help it's going to be,'' he said.
``This is not going to be a matter of hours, but of days.'' The
recorder was pulled out of the muck of the Florida Everglades crash
site and flown to Washington on Sunday.
</p><p>
   At the briefing, the safety board displayed the thick aluminum
recorder case, roughly the size of a hard-cover book, that held the
flight recorder in the jet's tail section. In the center of the
case was a deep puncture, evidence of an immense collision between
the recorder and something else as the plane hit the ground and
disintegrated.
</p><p>
   The penetration of the recorder case, which is meant to
withstand the worst of crashes, underscored the speed at which the
jet plummeted when it fell 7,500 feet into the swamp.
</p><p>
   ``It required an enormous amount of force, whatever went into
it,'' Francis said. ``We were extremely fortunate that we came out
with an intact piece of tape.''
</p><p>
   The tape did appear to confirm that crew members first found
evidence of a fire in the passenger cabin and not the cockpit.
Searchers said on Sunday that they had found a passenger seat frame
with melted aluminum that pointed to a cabin-area fire.
</p><p>
   But federal investigators have said they suspect the fire began
in the jet's forward cargo hold, directly below the cabin. A
principal theory is that one or more oxygen generators the jet
carried in its forward cargo hold accidentally activated.
</p><p>
   That would have produced intense heat and could have started an
explosion in any of several aircraft tires that were also stored in
the hold.
</p><p>
   Francis stressed on Monday, however, that experts had not yet
settled on a specific explanation and that they would continue to
search for clues at the Everglades crash site.
</p><p>
   In particular, he said the searchers would look for any parts
that helped control the plane's flight and for a set of circuit
breakers controlling the fuel pumps, which mechanics had worked on
in Atlanta, the plane's last stop before it flew to Miami.
</p><p>
   The disclosure that someone had to alert the pilots to the fire
also raises the question, perhaps never to be answered, of whether
the crash might have been averted had the DC-9 been equipped with
smoke detectors in its cargo hold.
</p><p>
   The National Transportation Safety Board had recommended before
the accident that cargo areas in passenger aircraft be outfitted
with fire-detection systems. But the Federal Aviation
Administration, which regulates the industry, has not acted on the
safety board's advice.
</p><p>
   Despite the damage to the flight recorder, safety officials were
hopeful of finding more clues to the crash. The tape ``had
obviously been subjected to impact and showed signs of that,''
Bernard Loeb, the director of the board's office of aviation
safety, said after Monday's briefing. It also had soaked in the
brackish water of the Everglades for two weeks.
</p><p>
   Even so, Loeb added, ``The tape was in generally good
condition.'' The greatest challenge facing the engineers who are
trying to pick scraps of conversation from the tape is not its
condition, he said, but the background noise from the jet's
cockpit.
</p><p>
   Loeb said such noise is common on tapes from cockpit recorders,
and varies according to the microphones in use in the cockpit at
the time. He said he was optimistic that much of the noise could be
removed by electronic filters and other means.
</p><p>
   The tape is intended to record continuously, saving the
most-recent 30 minutes of data, and Francis said a full half-hour
of conversation appeared to be on the recording.
</p><p>
   He also said there were ``some indications'' of gaps in the
recording similar to large gaps that punctuated the tape of the
jet's flight data recorder, which stores basic information about
the how the aircraft was piloted.
</p><p>
   Julie Beal, the safety board's spokesman, said the cockpit
recorder had been flown to Washington Sunday evening in a cooler
filled with swamp water to maintain the tape in the state in which
it had been found.

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MILLERSBURG, Ohio  A;N;D;MD;  Flight Officer Frank Gallion was buried here
near his home in Amish country on Monday, Memorial Day, more than
52 years after his P-47 Thunderbolt fighter plane was downed by
German machine gun fire and crashed into the waters of the Zuider
Zee.
</p><p>
   The 29-year-old pilot was reported missing on Nov. 3, 1943, his
body never found. Then last year the propeller of a Dutch dredging
ship hit something, and when a diver went down to investigate,
there, in 10 feet of water, was the skeleton of Gallion, almost
intact, seated in the cockpit of his plane.
</p><p>
   On Monday, at precisely 1 p.m. in a pouring rain, an honor guard
from Fort Knox, Ky., placed a container smaller than a shoe box
holding Gallion's ashes in the back of a long silver hearse. Then a
procession of 20 cars snaked past the Holmes County Courthouse and
war memorial, which look exactly as they did when Frank Gallion and
his brother, Ottmar, were boys swimming in Saps Run Creek, and on
past places that those country boys could never have imagined, like
the Wal-Mart and Pizza Hut on State Road 83.
</p><p>
   As the procession climbed the last hill before Pleasant Grove
Cemetery, Maj. David Deckard, the casualty officer who had
organized the ceremony, worried that there would be ``more press
and Army than mourners.'' But then his car reached the hill's
crest, and there, parked along the road to the cemetery, were cars
and pickups, Suburbans and minivans as far as the eye could see,
and the major was reminded of the strong pull that World War II
still holds for Americans.
</p><p>
   Of the more than 16 million Americans who served in the military
in World War II, the remains of about 78,700 have never been
recovered. Each year 10 to 20, like Gallion, are found by farmers
in France or the Netherlands or the South Pacific, by workers for
water authorities or highway departments.
</p><p>
   ``Sometimes they'll recover a B-17 or B-29 and we'll get back 8
or 9 in one aircraft,'' said Harold Campbell, the chief of
disposition for Army casualty and memorial affairs operations.
</p><p>
   Gallion, a member of the 334th Fighter Squadron, had taken off
from England that November day in 1943 to escort American B-17
bombers, part of a 500-plane attack force that passed over the
Netherlands on its way to a military base in Wilhelmshaven,
Germany.
</p><p>
   Two weeks later his wife, Phyllis, received a 17-word cable
saying that he was missing in action. Notice that he was mia
appeared in the Holmes County Farmer-Hub. In August 1945, his
mother placed a headstone for Gallion in Pleasant Grove Cemetery,
but his only surviving brother, Ottmar, now 78, said on Monday that
for years he had wondered whether Frank had been taken prisoner by
the Germans and died in a camp.
</p><p>
   As the decades passed, family members would periodically make
inquiries to Dutch and American officials, with no luck. In 1990,
Phyllis Gallion died. She had never remarried, nor had she had
children, but had worked much of her life as a hairdresser. Until
her mother-in-law's death in the late 1960s, Phyllis would visit
her once a year. After that, the Gallion family lost track of her.
</p><p>
   In early 1995, came word of the Dutch dredging company's find
about a quarter of a mile into the Zuider Zee, 50 miles north of
Amsterdam. Gary Gallion, a 43-year-old nephew, said the Dutch were
able to identify the uncle by his dog tags and a serial number on
the plane. After a ceremony in the Netherlands attended by family
members, the remains were flown to the Army's central
identification laboratory in Hawaii.
</p><p>
   Several weeks ago, Deckard, the casualty officer, drove the
``artifacts'' recovered from the plane to Gary Gallion's home in
this village of 3,200. ``It's not pretty stuff,'' the major told
the nephew and other family members as he spread the muddy items on
top of the kitchen table. ``But it is the facts of your uncle.''
</p><p>
   There were scraps of fabric, buttons, a rusted Zippo lighter, a
brass compass, a fishing lure that may have been part of a survival
kit, a pant cuff and two boot soles marked size 10-E. ``Frank had
thick ankles,'' Ottmar Gallion said.
</p><p>
   On Monday, before the funeral, people asked what Frank had been
like, and Ottmar, who had earned a living as a laborer and
salesman, seemed to have trouble remembering so far back. Mainly he
spoke of their hiking trips, their swimming together in the creek
and their competitiveness. Ottmar Gallion had spent the war
guarding German prisoners in Oklahoma and he was asked, if perhaps,
Frank, who had gone to Canada in 1941 to join up early, had been
the more adventurous brother.
</p><p>
   ``Oh, I wouldn't say so,'' he replied. ``I was the only one
around here who would dive off the bridge into the river.''
</p><p>
   At the graveside service on Monday in the pouring rain there
were women and children, Vietnam veterans like Jim Buehler, World
War II veterans like Francis Emerick and Ted Anielski, Robert
Spahr, a villager, who grew up next door to the Gallions and
Gallion's only surviving sister, Clela Joy Davis 88, who lives
nearby in the Walnut Creek nursing home.
</p><p>
   Family members sat in three rows under a tent facing the box of
ashes atop a table.
</p><p>
   There were several speakers, including an Army chaplain, the
minister from the family's Seventh Day Adventist Church and Rep.
Ralph Regula, the area's Congressman. Ottmar Gallion spoke for the
family. He said there was relief and closure in finding how his
brother died.
</p><p>
   ``It was a clean kill, he was out of his misery and from then on
the thing was in God's hands,'' he said.
</p><p>
   Many times in recent weeks, Ottmar Gallion had said he wasn't
saddened; it was all so long ago. But by the conclusion of his
speech on Monday, his voice was barely audible, and when he sat
down, he blew his nose.
</p><p>
   At the end there was a 21-gun salute, a bugler blowing taps and
then First Lt. William J. Duggan III presented Ottmar Gallion with
an American flag.
</p><p>
   Afterwards, the whole village was invited to American Legion
Post 192 in downtown Millersburg. ``They're going to have a nice
little spread,'' Deckard said.

INSPECTOR MAKES WAVES WITH IDEAS ON AIRLINE SAFETY
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By DAVID GOLDSTEIN
c. 1996 Kansas City Star
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  She's been an organized-crime prosecutor in Kansas
City, and she's worked in the Reagan White House. She's had a top
post in the Labor Department and been featured as one of ``10
outstanding young working women'' in Glamour magazine.
</p><p>
   She can even fly a plane and throw her voice.
</p><p>
   Mary Fackler Schiavo has skipped from one high-profile job to
another like a stone dancing across a pond.
</p><p>
   Except now she has made a ripple, and a big one at that.
</p><p>
   When ValuJet Flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades on
May 11, the issue of Newsweek on the stands that Saturday carried a
Schiavo column about airline safety.
</p><p>
   ``I go out of my way to stay off commuter planes,'' she wrote.
``... I would not fly on marginal airlines (and because of its many
mishaps, I also avoided flying ValuJet.)''
</p><p>
   But this was more than just a personal essay from a trained
pilot and frequent flier.
</p><p>
   Schiavo, known as Mary Sterling when she lived in Kansas City,
is the inspector general for the Department of Transportation. In
her words, she is ``helping to police the country's skies.''
</p><p>
   More succinctly, she's been one of the most outspoken
bureaucrats about aircraft safety, inspections and the problem of
faulty parts installed in planes.
</p><p>
   Her role as the Cassandra of the airways has put her on opposite
sides of others in federal airline regulation. But if Schiavo was a
flash point for criticism before her column and the crash, she's
now at the center of the controversy.
</p><p>
   Her superiors at the Transportation Department, where the party
line is always that the government has complete confidence in the
airline industry, blanched at her comments.
</p><p>
   David Hinson, head of the Federal Aviation Administration, said
Schiavo was ``entitled to her opinion.'' Transportation Secretary
Federico Pena has assured the public that ValuJet is safe.
</p><p>
   Schiavo's critics in the industry say that, while she is smart
and aggressive, she is a media hound who has unnecessarily
frightened the traveling public.
</p><p>
   ``I think the FAA needs to increase and enhance its training and
pay attention to things like unapproved parts and other issues she
has brought to the forefront,'' said Sarah MacLeod, a lawyer and
executive director of the Aeronautical Repair Station Association,
which represents companies that repair airline parts. ``I agree
with her on a lot of her points. I don't agree with how she is
going about her job and overstepping her boundaries, and I don't
agree with her grabbing headlines.''
</p><p>
   Schiavo could not be reached for comment. She has kept quiet
since the days immediately following the ValuJet crash, when she
was on national television saying that the low-budget carrier's
record was under review.
</p><p>
   The 40-year-old prosecutor-turned-political appointee became the
Transportation Department's inspector general in 1990 after a swift
rise in government and political circles.
</p><p>
   She grew up on a farm and attended school in a small town
outside of Toledo, Ohio, where she was twirling champion. She also
taught herself ventriloquism as a hobby, was flying by the age of
10 and became a certified pilot at 18. She earned degrees from Ohio
State, Harvard and New York University.
</p><p>
   Schiavo joined the U.S. attorney's office in Kansas City in 1982
at age 27. Missouri Court of Appeals Judge Robert G. Ulrich, the
U.S. attorney at the time, remembers that her letter of application
and resume stood out among the nearly 400 he received during his
eight years as prosecutor.
</p><p>
   ``It was impressive,'' he said. ``... I suspect the way Mary
approaches things, she recognizes and determines a goal; then she
goes and gets it.''
</p><p>
   Schiavo worked for Ulrich for three years and then joined the
federal Organized Crime Strike Force for a year. At time she was
married to lawyer Ed Sterling, the chairman of the Jackson County
Republican Party.
</p><p>
   She left Kansas City to become a White House fellow and a
special assistant to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese. She
returned to Missouri in 1988 to run President Bush's presidential
campaign in the state.
</p><p>
   Schiavo aggressively sought Ulrich's post when he left, but she
didn't make the final cut of three candidates. The U.S. attorney
job eventually went to Jean Paul Bradshaw II.
</p><p>
   She worked for the McDowell, Rice A;N;D;AMP; Smith law firm for a while
but returned to Washington to work for then-Secretary of Labor
Elizabeth Dole as an assistant secretary for labor-management
standards.
</p><p>
   As inspector general at Transportation, she has been credited by
many for pushing the FAA to get tough on the problems of faulty
parts and for beefing up the criminal dimension of her office.
</p><p>
   Aviation Week A;N;D;AMP; Space Technology magazine praised her this year
for winning more than 100 convictions in her investigations. Last
week the journal complimented her work on ValuJet but also fired a
dart.
</p><p>
   ``She should stick to what she does best,'' the magazine
editorialized, ``finding problems, not creating them.''
</p><p>
   She also took criticism after she butted heads with a top FAA
official, accusing him of blocking one of her investigations. He
was cleared by the Justice Department, but the episode painted her
in some quarters as someone who acted outside proper channels and
was magnetized by the glare of publicity.
</p><p>
   The Clinton White House has shown no indications that it plans
to take any action against Schiavo, who was appointed in the Bush
administration. Among some on Capitol Hill, however, the mood is
that of a hunter who suddenly finds prey in his sights.
</p><p>
   Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, the Republican chairman of the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which has oversight over the
inspector generals, was furious at her comments about the safety of
commuter planes.
</p><p>
   ``That's easily 90 percent of the traffic in Alaska,'' said
Mitch Rose, a Stevens aide. ``(Stevens) has never been approached
by her or been given that impression. He thought her statements
were over-broad.''
</p><p>
   Stevens' committee plans to review two years' worth of Schiavo's
audits and investigative reports to see whether they bear out her
Newsweek comments.
</p><p>
   MacLeod said Schiavo and everyone involved in the debate over
airline safety needed a dose of reality.
</p><p>
   ``We have the safest airline system in the world,'' she said,
``but life comes with no guarantees.''

DC-9 COCKPIT TAPE CONTAINS NOISE SUPPORTING BLAST THEORY
(sw)
By MATTHEW L. WALD
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  The cockpit voice recorder of the Valujet Airlines
DC-9 that crashed in the Everglades on May 11 recorded ``a brief
unidentified sound'' less than six minutes after takeoff, and
almost immediately, the captain ``stated the need to go back to
Miami,'' National Transportation Safety Board investigators said on
Thursday evening.
</p><p>
   The investigators' brief statement does not say what the sound
was, and, in fact, refers to it four times on a single page as
``unidentified.'' But a chronology in the statement seems to show
that the crew acted properly in response to the noise.
</p><p>
   The crash killed all 110 people on board, and investigators
found parts of oxygen generators embedded in a fire-damaged tire.
Aviation experts said on Thursday evening that a possible source of
the sound would be the pop of a spare aircraft tire if it had been
heated by a fire in the forward cargo hold. The board has already
said that the plane was carrying oxygen generators, which can start
fires, and that some of these had been stacked on top of an
inflated tire.
</p><p>
   The flight data recorder, which has already been analyzed, gives
evidence that there might have been an explosion on board. The
statement released on Thursday, describing a preliminary analysis
of the voice recorder, did not state unequivocally that the sound
was related to the crash but gives a partial chronology keyed
around that event: The sound occurred about 5 minutes and 47
seconds after takeoff; the captain ``questioned'' the sound; 17
seconds after hearing it, she said the plane, which was still
climbing on its way to Atlanta, must return to Miami.
</p><p>
   Five seconds later, ``voices were heard from the passenger cabin
reporting fire.'' Eleven seconds after that, the co-pilot radioed
for clearance to return. The crash occurred about seven minutes
later.
</p><p>
   The sequence, as described by the investigators, indicates that
the crew took prompt action to try to land, which aviation experts
say is the most important step pilots can take in the event of a
fire. An unresolved question is whether the plane could have landed
closer than Miami.
</p><p>
   The statement also said ``the aircraft and systems appear normal
before the unidentified sound.'' Afterwards, the statement said,
there were two apparent interruptions of power to the cockpit voice
recorder. The first began 1 minute and 39 seconds after the sound
and lasted 1 minute and 17 seconds; the second was just before the
end of the tape.
</p><p>
   Aviation experts say the reason could be fire damage to the
plane's electrical system, or could be the crew, believing that the
problem was an electrical fire, turning off various electrical
systems. Electrical problems have not been ruled out.

   Previous incidents involving the carrying of hazardous air
cargo:
</p><p>
   NOV. 3, 1973  A;N;D;MD; 
</p><p>
   Heavy smoke and fumes cause a crash that kills three crewmen and
destroys a Pan Am Boeing 707. An improperly packaged container of
nitric acid burst into flames in the cargo compartment. The Clipper
160 cargo plane bound from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport to
Frankfurt, Germany, crashed during an emergency landing at Boston's
Logan Airport. After the crash, the Air Line Pilots Association
formally recommended to the Safety Board that ``all hazardous
materials be banned from interstate air transportation.''
</p><p>
   AUG. 19, 1980  A;N;D;MD; 
</p><p>
   A cargo compartment fire spreads through a Saudi Arabian
Airlines L-1011, killing all 301 people aboard. The pilot was able
to successfully land the jet in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. But
evacuation attempts failed. Although unable to determine the cause
of the fire, the National Transportation Safety Board used the
incident to push for better methods for containing fires in cargo
holds. The FAA recommended installation of fiberglass ceiling
liners in lieu of the standard C-2 Nomex fabric liners used in
cargo compartments at the time.
</p><p>
   AUG. 10, 1986  A;N;D;MD; 
</p><p>
   Fire consumes an American Trans Air DC-10 after passenger and
crew deplane in Chicago. A jostled oxygen generating canister  A;N;D;MD; 
similar to the ones carried aboard ValuJet Flight 592  A;N;D;MD;  set off the
fire in the cargo hold.
</p><p>
   FEB. 3, 1988  A;N;D;MD; 
</p><p>
   An American Airlines DC-9 makes an emergency landing in
Nashville, forcing 126 passengers and crew to evacuate after
chemicals illegally shipped from Austin start a fire in the cargo
hold. The floor in the passenger cabin melted and smoke wafted
through the cabin. The National Transportation Safety Board called
for fire detection and extinguishing equipment in Class D cargo
holds. The FAA rejected the recommendation because it would cost
more than $350 million to retrofit existing aircraft.
</p><p>
   FEB. 1, 1991  A;N;D;MD; 
</p><p>
   Fire breaks out in the cargo hold of a DC-9 bound from Charlotte
to Greensboro, N.C. No one is injured, but an illegal cache of tear
gas, volatile liquid dichloromethane, lamp oil, witch hazel and
matches are found in the cargo compartment.
</p><p>
   AUG. 20, 1993  A;N;D;MD; 
</p><p>
   A leaking package containing blood tainted with the HIV virus
was packed as air freight in Santa Rosa, Calif. Several cargo
loaders handled the unmarked package before someone placed it in a
clear plastic bag. An inspection revealed the package contained
human tissue and blood samples, which laboratory tests revealed
were positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which
causes AIDS.

FAA FACES PROBLEMS IN MONITORING AIRLINE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS
(af)
By ADAM BRYANT
c. 1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   With the nation's airlines farming out an increasing amount of
maintenance work, the Federal Aviation Administration is struggling
to monitor an intricate web of contractors that stretches around
the world.
</p><p>
   Before deregulation of the industry in 1978, airlines did most
of their work themselves, making it relatively simple for
regulators to examine records and aircraft to insure that
procedures were being followed properly.
</p><p>
   But now that task is far more complicated than experts predicted
even five years ago. United States airlines are trying to save
money by hiring companies domestically and overseas for major tasks
like overhauling engines, and they are farming out maintenance and
critical safety-related work like de-icing to various companies at
the many airports they serve.
</p><p>
   With this practice  A;N;D;MD;  often called outsourcing  A;N;D;MD;  the potential
for misunderstanding inevitably grows, aviation experts say,
particularly because few airlines operate exactly the same way.
</p><p>
   Federal officials believe that such a misunderstanding may have
led to the May 11 crash of a Valujet DC-9 outside Miami. Valujet
and its contractor Sabretech, a maintenance company that does work
in Miami, are arguing over who was responsible for handling
oxygen-generating devices that investigators suspect caused the
crash, which killed 110 passengers and crew.
</p><p>
   The growing use of outsourcing by both start-up airlines like
Valujet and major carriers is not inherently unsafe, experts say,
and the FAA has responsibility for authorizing contractors in many
foreign countries.
</p><p>
   But such relationships do require more supervision. And the FAA
has always assigned its front-line inspectors according to an
airline's size, not its use of subcontractors.
</p><p>
   ``The nature of the beast has changed,'' said Daniel M. Kasper,
an aviation consultant and a member of a 1993 presidential
commission that studied the airline industry.
</p><p>
   ``While flying remains the safest form of transportation, it
raises the question of whether the FAA regulatory model has changed
sufficiently to oversee these virtual airlines.''
</p><p>
   Valujet could be considered a prime example of a ``virtual
airline,'' relying heavily on contractors. Sabretech is one of six
companies that Valujet hired to do heavy maintenance, and Valujet
has also contracted with more than a dozen other companies,
including airlines, to work on its planes at various airports.
</p><p>
   Valujet's dispute with Sabretech centers on the oxygen
generators, which are small chemical reactors that produce intense
heat when activated.
</p><p>
   Sabretech, which is an FAA-authorized maintenance company,
removed them from Valujet MD-80s because the generators' shelf life
had expired and Valujet officials said they told the contractor to
dispose of them.
</p><p>
   Sabretech said it was given no such order and boxed up the
generators, mislabeled them ``Oxy Cannisters, Empty,'' and returned
them to Valujet. Valujet then loaded the boxes into the cargo hold
of Flight 592.
</p><p>
   Internal FAA records show that on several occasions, inspectors
were concerned about a lack of oversight by Valujet of its
contractors. An inspector found, for instance, that maintenance was
not properly documented by one contractor and that Valujet lacked
procedures to make sure it was done.
</p><p>
   The FAA also found that Valujet did not make sure that companies
it hired  A;N;D;MD;  including other airlines like Northwest and Carnival  A;N;D;MD; 
were properly trained in its procedures. A company that trained
Valujet pilots did not send the airline records documenting poor
performance of the Valujet employees.
</p><p>
   After an engine broke up in a Valujet DC-9 that was about to
take off from Atlanta last June, the FAA wrote to Valujet, telling
it to develop safeguards against acquiring ``questionable assets.''
</p><p>
   The plane was one of nine that Valujet bought from a Turkish
airline, which had worked on the faulty engine for a period when
its FAA authorization had lapsed.
</p><p>
   As part of its closer scrutiny of Valujet after the crash, the
FAA said it would conduct new inspections of Valujet's contractors.
Valujet has suspended its contract with Sabretech and Valujet
officials said they had improved their internal audit system for
working with contractors.
</p><p>
   Lewis H. Jordan, the airline's president, said the airline had
been ``very responsive'' in addressing each of the FAA's concerns.
</p><p>
   Other internal reports show that the agency was concerned that
its own oversight of Valujet was insufficient.
</p><p>
   Its inspection records ``clearly show some weakness in the FAA's
surveillance,'' said an internal report released by the agency this
month. In addition, the report recommended to top FAA officials
that they consider a top-to-bottom check of Valujet, in part
because of the ``absence of adequate policies and procedures for
the maintenance personnel to follow.''
</p><p>
   A separate report described Valujet as an ``unconventional
carrier,'' noting that it contracted out all its maintenance to
``geographically diverse low bidders.'' In an interview, Jordan
said that cost was not Valujet's only consideration in choosing its
contractors.
</p><p>
   David R. Hinson, the FAA administrator, said that the widespread
use of outsourcing in the industry is ``a relatively young
phenomenon'' and creates different challenges of oversight for the
agency, compared to when airlines were largely self-contained
organizations.

FATAL AIRLINE ATTACK DESCRIBED IN TERROR TRIAL
(bl)
By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  A;N;D;MD;  Prosecutors focused Monday on a deadly midair
explosion that Ramzi Yousef is accused of carrying out as a
rehearsal for a planned wave of attacks on a dozen American
jetliners, a continuation of a terror campaign that the indictment
says began with the World Trade Center bombing.
</p><p>
   The bomb exploded aboard Philippines Airlines Flight 434,
killing one passenger and injuring several others, as the Boeing
747 flew from Cebu in the southern Philippines to Tokyo on Dec. 11,
1994. The pilot, who testified Monday, managed to make an emergency
landing in Okinawa after the blast.
</p><p>
   Yousef is accused of planting the bomb himself on the first leg
of the flight from Manila to Cebu before quietly disembarking. He
and the other two defendants are accused of conspiring to replicate
that tactic in two days of terror they are said to have planned at
airports around Asia to kill several thousand passengers.
</p><p>
   But Yousef  A;N;D;MD;  who has insisted upon conducting his own defense,
against the advice of the judge in the case  A;N;D;MD;  sought to gain some
advantage from Monday's testimony, suggesting in his
cross-examination of the witnesses that the bomb had been planted
by someone else, even one of Philippine Airlines' own maintenance
or cleaning workers.
</p><p>
   So far, the only witness to place Yousef on the flight from
Manila to Cebu has been a Philippine Airlines flight attendant,
Maria De La Cruz. She testified Thursday that she had seen him
briefly occupy the seat that later exploded. She served him a
beverage and snack before he got off in Cebu, she said.
</p><p>
   When the trial reconvened Monday morning, the prosecutors,
Dietrich L. Snell and Michael J. Garcia, went on to present three
witnesses: the jetliner's Filipino captain, a Japanese passenger
who was injured in the explosion and a retired Okinawan police
officer who supervised the bombing investigation after the aircraft
landed at Naha in Okinawa.
</p><p>
   Taking the stand, the aircraft's captain, Eduardo Reyes,
testified that the sudden explosion had forced his plane, which had
nearly 300 passengers on board, to bank sharply to the right. ``It
was as if a big rocket exploded right in the room,'' Reyes said.
When he took the controls, he had to use force to make a wide turn.
``The plane responded, but very slowly,'' he said.
</p><p>
   The captain said he had landed the damaged jumbo jetliner at the
Naha airport a half-hour later, after the control tower and another
small plane verified that his landing gear was down.
</p><p>
   When Yousef cross-examined Reyes, he asked who else, including
mechanics and cleaners, had been given access to the plane's
interior while it was in Manila and Cebu. He also asked why the
flight had departed behind schedule.
</p><p>
   ``Do you know whether the late arrival of the stairs was
deliberate or not?'' Yousef asked.
</p><p>
   ``No, sir,'' said the captain, who seemed puzzled by the
questioning. Yousef asked later whether passengers were required to
show passports before boarding. ``That is not my line, sir,'' the
pilot said. ``My job is to fly the aircraft.''
</p><p>
   The injured passenger, Yukihiko Ususi, said he had been sleeping
in the seat behind the passenger who was killed, Haruki Ikegami.
When the blast occurred, Ususi said, he thought that the airliner
had crashed. Speaking through a Japanese interpreter, Ususi said he
had tried to use the oxygen mask dangling above him, ``but then I
realized the oxygen mask was burned and was useless.''
</p><p>
   Ikegami tried to ask for help and then collapsed, said Ususi,
who then discovered that his own legs were ``burned and bloody.''
Ususi said he had looked at Ikegami ``and he looked dead.''
</p><p>
   Ususi said he had been hospitalized for 16 days in Okinawa, had
surgery twice and spent four more months in his local hospital in
Japan. ``My legs occasionally still ache, and also I have a ringing
sensation in my ear,'' he said.
</p><p>
   In a brief cross-examination of Ususi, Yousef asked whether he
was aware of blackmailing and other crimes committed against
Japanese businessmen in the Philippines in December 1994. ``I
didn't know,'' replied Ususi, looking baffled by the question.
</p><p>
   The defendant contends that he was being tortured in a Pakistani
prison at the time prosecutors accuse him of being in the
Philippines and plotting to blow up 12 American jetliners with his
co-defendants, Abdul Hakim Murad and Wali Khan Amin Shah.
</p><p>
   The prosecutors say they can prove that Yousef was in the
Philippines at that time through Yousef's computer records and
fingerprints and other evidence.
</p><p>
   Yousef faces a subsequent trial later this year on charges of
masterminding the bombing of the World Trade Center in February
1993, an attack that killed six people and injured hundreds.

WHISTLEBLOWER SHIELD: AVIATION WORKERS WANT PROTECTION WHEN THEY
REPORT TROUBLE

<TEXT>
<p>
   ATLANTA  A;N;D;MD;  Flight attendant Nancy Chagares says when she heard
that a ValuJet plane, just deemed unairworthy by a pilot, had taken
off with a new crew and passengers, she didn't hesitate to report
it to her supervisors.
</p><p>
   For her effort, she says, she was forced to resign.
</p><p>
   ``If you raise questions about anything, by God, they are going
to get rid of you,'' she says.
</p><p>
   A ValuJet spokesman said the airline investigated Chagares'
claims about the incident last New Year's Eve and did not force her
out of her job.
</p><p>
   But stories like hers have prompted aviation employees to fight
for the same protection thousands of other workers have: the
freedom to fight back legally if they are punished for blowing the
whistle.
</p><p>
   A bill pending in Congress would bar airlines and their
contractors from discriminating against an employee who reports
safety problems. Violations could be reported to the U.S.
Department of Labor or, eventually, a federal court.
</p><p>
   Supporters say they hope last month's fatal crash of ValuJet
Flight 592 helps speed passage of the law. A hearing before a
congressional subcommittee could be held as early as July 10.
</p><p>
   ``On any airline, if there are problems, it's the people working
on the planes who will see them,'' said Jill Gallagher, spokeswoman
for the Association of Flight Attendants. ``Relying on the workers
would be a good thing.''
</p><p>
   U.S. Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), who introduced the bill, said
the fatal crash of a USAir flight in Charlotte two years ago
prompted his concern.
</p><p>
   ``I take at least four flights a week,'' he said. ``For me to
sit there knowing a flight attendant is not on the team making sure
I am safe (because of a fear to report problems) is unbelievable.''
</p><p>
   ValuJet and Delta, both based in Atlanta, say they do protect
employees who report problems and have telephone lines that
employees can call anonymously. Both say they encourage employees
to talk to their supervisors and do not discipline them for
reporting problems.
</p><p>
   ``It's an open-door policy,'' said ValuJet spokesman Gregg
Kenyon. They also may report concerns to the Federal Aviation
Administration, but ValuJet prefers that they do not go to the news
media, spokeswoman Marcia Scott said.
</p><p>
   Valujet flight attendant Anna Wooten said on ABC's ``Nightline''
last month that ``flight attendants are afraid to say anything.''
When the reporter mentioned that she was still working for the
airline, she replied, ``Probably won't be after this interview.''
</p><p>
   Wooten currently is on maternity leave, Scott said.
</p><p>
   Chagares, a former Atlantic Southeast Airlines flight attendant,
said her problems began a little more than three weeks after she
started working for ValuJet.
</p><p>
   She said she was working in the airline's Atlanta operations
center Dec. 31 when a pilot came in and told the operations
supervisor that his plane needed several days worth of maintenance
and he would not fly it.
</p><p>
   The pilot was assigned to a different plane, she said, but 15
minutes later ``they boarded up the (first) plane with another crew
and they left,'' she said. She said someone asked if that was the
same plane that had maintenance problems and the supervisor
replied, ``It was the only one they had.''
</p><p>
   ``I don't know if what was wrong with the airplane was fixed,''
she said. ``If they can do two days' work in 15 minutes, they
really are a wonderful airline.''
</p><p>
   The next day, she told her supervisor and refused to fly again
until she got answers about what happened.
</p><p>
   ``We took her concerns very seriously,'' ValuJet's Kenyon said.
He said the airline investigated but found no records of
maintenance problems in the log books. ``We took her concerns very
seriously,'' he said. ``We found no discrepancies and nothing wrong
with the aircraft.''
</p><p>
   He added that Chagares ``was offered various counseling and did
not come back.''
</p><p>
   Chagares said she was told in early February to start flying or
they would assume she didn't want her job anymore.
</p><p>
   ``Nobody in that company will say anything, nobody,'' she said.
``That's why that whistleblower law is needed so badly.''
</p><p>
   While ValuJet's Scott said she was not familiar with the
whistleblower legislation, she said, ``Anything that provides the
airline and its people with a method of guaranteeing a higher level
of safety is great.'' .

HOUSE VOTES TO KEEP DRUNKEN BOAT, PLANE OPERATORS FROM HIDING
BEHIND FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS
By CHRISTI HARLAN
c.1996 Cox News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  Seven years ago this month, 22-year-old Deborah Ann
Rock died on Lake Austin when she was hit by the bow and propeller
of a boat that smashed into the idling boat in which she was
sitting.
</p><p>
   Rock's parents won a $500,000 award from an Austin, Texas, jury
against the pilot of the moving boat, John Greenway. But 3 1/2
years later, the Rocks have yet to collect a penny from Greenway,
thanks to the protection of federal bankruptcy law.
</p><p>
   That protection should not be available in future cases
involving boats and alcohol, the House decided Tuesday. By a voice
vote, members of the House closed a loophole in bankruptcy law that
shielded drunk pilots of boats and airplanes from liability for
accidents that hurt or kill others.
</p><p>
   ``In the past, watercraft and aircraft operators have had little
fear of punishment knowing that this loophole existed,'' said U.S.
Rep. Vernon J. Ehlers, R-Mich., the sponsor of the measure. ``With
this bill, the federal government will be doing its part to
supplement what the states . . . are doing to combat drunk boating
and flying.''
</p><p>
   Bankruptcy law currently allows debtors to cancel most of their
debts, with about a dozen exceptions. Those include federal taxes,
student loans and ``any debt for death or personal injury caused by
the debtor's operation of a motor vehicle'' while intoxicated by
alcohol or drugs.
</p><p>
   In at least three cases, including the Rocks' case against
Greenway, courts have wrestled with the question of whether boats
are ``motor vehicles'' and whether drunk drivers of boats should be
shielded from liability.
</p><p>
   ``I'm just stunned that it's a hard question,'' said Karl O.
Bayer Jr. of Austin, the lawyer for two other people who were in
the boat in which Rock was killed. ``I didn't even figure it would
be a close call.''
</p><p>
   But two courts have agreed with Greenway and his lawyers that
the 21-foot Supra powerboat he was piloting June 30, 1989, was not
a motor vehicle. Those rulings have kept Greenway from having to
pay the judgments won by the passengers and pilot of the other
boat.
</p><p>
   The legislation approved Tuesday will not affect the Rocks' case
against Greenway, but the case was one of three cited last November
by the House Judiciary Committee when it reported on the need for
the legislation changing the bankruptcy law.
</p><p>
   The crash occurred on Lake Austin near the Loop 360 bridge as
Rock, two other passengers and the pilot sat on an idle 18-foot
Maxum powerboat. Greenway's boat hit the Maxum from behind and
became airborne, striking and killing Rock and severely injuring
another woman passenger.
</p><p>
   The wreck happened about an hour before Texas'
boating-while-intoxicated law took effect. Greenway, whose
blood-alcohol level was between 0.09 and 0.11, was indicted on a
misdemeanor charge of criminally negligent homicide and pleaded no
contest to the charge in August 1990. He was sentenced to 30 days
in jail and fined $1,000.
</p><p>
   Greenway, now a lawyer in Austin, sought bankruptcy-court
protection shortly after a civil-court jury voted in December 1992
to award $500,000 in damages to Rock's parents and a total of
$300,000 to three other people who were on the boat with Rock.
</p><p>
   A bankruptcy judge in Austin ruled that Greenway could escape
liability for the judgments because a boat is not a motor vehicle
as described in bankruptcy law. That ruling was overturned in April
1995 by U.S. District Judge James Nowlin of Austin, who wrote that
he could ``see no reason why Congress would have been concerned
with drunk driving in one context and not the other.''
</p><p>
   Earlier this year, Nowlin's ruling was reversed by the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which said a boat is not a motor vehicle.
The attorneys for Rock's parents, from the Austin firm of Spivey,
Grigg, Kelly and Knisely, have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear
the case.
</p><p>
   Greenway, reached at his office, declined to comment.
</p><p>
   ``There's plenty I'd like to say,'' he said, ``but it's still in
court.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  Adm. Jay L. Johnson, one of the fastest-rising
stars in the Navy, faces the most daunting challenge of his 28-year
career in taking command of a service wracked by tragedy and
turmoil.
</p><p>
   President Clinton, calling this a ``crucial time'' in the Navy's
history, Wednesday tapped Johnson to succeed his mentor, Adm.
Jeremy Boorda, who committed suicide three weeks ago.
</p><p>
   Colleagues describe Johnson, who became 50 on Wednesday, as a
smart, decisive and low-key officer who as the new Chief of Naval
Operations would move quickly to reassure a Navy badly shaken by
the death of his popular predecessor. Johnson, a 1968 graduate of
the U.S. Naval Academy, has been the vice chief of naval operations
since April 1.
</p><p>
   ``Jay is a very steady, solid force who gives the impression of
being unflappable,'' said Stanley R. Arthur, a retired admiral who
commanded Navy forces in the Persian Gulf war. ``He'll present a
soothing image. You won't see a lot of flash and dash from him.''
</p><p>
   There is little doubt about the admiral's combat credentials. A
fighter pilot with 150 combat missions during the Vietnam War,
Johnson won praise as head of the Second Fleet during the U.S.
intervention in Haiti in 1994, helping to coordinate the flying of
Army helicopters off a Navy aircraft carrier.
</p><p>
   A larger question is whether Johnson can overcome a relative
lack of experience in the crucible of Washington politicking and
in-fighting to turn around the military's most troubled service and
win over skeptics in Congress.
</p><p>
   Although Boorda did not attend the 1991 Tailhook convention, a
gathering of naval aviators in Las Vegas where 83 women were
assaulted, he was dogged by its legacy. Cheating and drugs at the
prestigious Naval Academy and a series of crashes involving the
Navy's fleet of aging F-14 fighter jets combined to create an image
of a Navy spinning out of control.
</p><p>
   Now these are Johnson's problems to resolve.
</p><p>
   ``He's got a very tough job ahead of him,'' said Barbara Pope,
who worked with Johnson when she was a senior Navy personnel
official in the Bush administration.
</p><p>
   Senior Pentagon officials expressed hope Wednesday that Johnson,
a tall, striking figure and articulate speaker, would by his sheer
presence and leadership propel the Navy, and its 422,000 men and
women, off the shoals of misfortune.
</p><p>
   But in contrast to the effervescent Boorda, who openly promoted
his common touch with sailors and his skill as a bureaucratic
infighter, Johnson is more self-effacing and is not particularly
well known, even within the Navy.
</p><p>
   ``He's not a big headline grabber,'' said Arthur. ``But people
will expect an awful lot out of him. One thing he does need to do
is keep visible.''
</p><p>
   If the Senate confirms his nomination, Johnson would be one of
the youngest men to head the Navy in this century. He would also
become the first aviator to assume the Navy's top-ranking job since
1982.

FAA CHIEF SAYS AGENCY SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE TO MONITOR VALUJET
OPERATIONS
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE
c.1996 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  The government's top regulator of the airline
industry said Tuesday that his agency should have done more to
monitor maintenance at ValuJet Airlines, which ceased operations
after a crash last month in Florida took 110 lives.
</p><p>
   ``We should have done a better job helping ValuJet manage their
infrastructure, especially with respect to maintenance,'' David
Hinson, chief of the Federal Aviation Administration, told
Congress.
</p><p>
   Hinson said in testimony before the House Transportation
Committee that the rapid growth of the low-cost, start-up airline
appeared to exceed its ability to perform proper maintenance on its
aircraft.
</p><p>
   ``A year ago in April they had about 25 airplanes, and they grew
to 50 by February,'' Hinson said. ``In that time frame, we might
have done a better of job of saying, `Why don't you slow down? Your
systems may not be quite capable of helping you manage your
growth.' There are some lessons learned there for us.''
</p><p>
   Hinson also told lawmakers that he would be leaving the FAA by
the end of the year. The FAA announced last week that it was
accepting the retirement of the agency's assistant administrator,
Anthony Broderick.
</p><p>
   Atlanta-based ValuJet and the FAA have come under intense
scrutiny since the May 11 crash of ValuJet Flight 592. Everyone
aboard was killed when the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 plunged nose
first into the Florida Everglades shortly after takeoff from Miami.
</p><p>
   ValuJet halted operations at the request of the FAA, which said
it found a series of maintenance problems during an intense
post-crash review of the carrier's operations.
</p><p>
   Industry and government experts complain that the FAA was lax in
overseeing ValuJet and that the airline did not ensure that its
maintenance operations kept pace with the rapid expansion of its
fleet and routes.
</p><p>
   Mary Schiavo, inspector general for the Transportation
Department, told lawmakers in the nine-hour hearing that she had
complained to the department about poor performance of FAA
inspectors and potential problems in the fast-growing airline
industry.
</p><p>
   ``We believe that there is a culture of unaccountability at the
FAA,'' Schiavo said. ``Let's look at ValuJet. They conducted 5,000
inspections before the crash. Only after the crash, after the
public scrutiny, after the media started digging and after some
whistle blowers came forward was there action.''
</p><p>
   ValuJet President Lewis Jordan defended his airline.
</p><p>
   ``Some have suggested that because ValuJet charges lower fares,
the safety of the airline is also lower,'' Jordan told lawmakers.
``This is patently false. ValuJet is able to offer low fares
because we cut frills. We have not and will never cut corners when
it comes to safety.''
</p><p>
   But David Stempler, an analyst with AirTrav Advisers, an air
travel consulting firm, said the FAA should ground ValuJet
permanently, which would keep the carrier's owners and senior
management ``from ever operating an airline in the United States
again.''
</p><p>
   ``This would be a fitting penalty,'' Stempler said, ``for a
group of high-risk, financial entrepreneurs who have brought us
ValuJet, which ... was an accident waiting to happen.''
</p><p>
   Hinson told lawmakers that investigators of the National
Transportation Safety Board have not found a link between the
Florida crash and sloppy maintenance by outside contractors
discovered by the FAA in its post-crash review.
</p><p>
   But NTSB chairman Jim Hall said the FAA should have learned of
the potential dangers of outside maintenance contractors 20 years
ago.
</p><p>
   He said the NTSB first cautioned the agency on the matter in
1976, when a DC-6 operated by a small regional carrier crashed near
Van Nuys, Calif. He said workers for a maintenance contractor had
improperly installed a propeller blade on the plane.
</p><p>
   Hall added that the government must look carefully again at what
he called ``virtual airlines''  A;N;D;MD;  carriers that provide
transportation but conduct none of their own maintenance or
training.
</p><p>
   ``We will analyze how carriers that outsource these services are
ensuring the safety of their operations,'' Hall said.
</p><p>
   Sen. William S. Cohen, R-Maine, chairman of a Senate committee
that oversees government management, said the FAA told lawmakers a
decade ago that it was troubled by poor maintenance standards at
start-up carriers.
</p><p>
   ``Perhaps the biggest single problem our inspector work force
has faced is the management of new entrants,'' assistant
administrator Broderick told a Senate panel in 1986. ``The
proliferation of contract maintenance has been difficult to deal
with and has caused a large workload.''
</p><p>
   Cohen told the House committee Tuesday: ``Contract maintenance
is not a new trend, but an old problem that has gone unaddressed
and unsolved.''

EFFECT OF WINDS WEIGHED IN DEATH OF `FLYING ELVIS'
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By KATE HUNGER
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BOSTON  A;N;D;MD;  Less than 24 hours after a publicity parachute jump
turned tragic, controversy surfaced over the cause  A;N;D;MD;  whether the
jump should have been made in high winds or if the chutists had
been dropped at the wrong spot  A;N;D;MD;  and the pilot pointing to wind
shears as a possible explanation.
</p><p>
   And the Federal Aviation Administration said it would
investigate whether any regulations had been violated in the
incident that left one of four Elvis impersonators dead.
</p><p>
   Raymond E. Sayles 3d of Las Vegas, one of four parachutists with
the Honeymoon in Vegas Skydiving Exhibition Team, died Wednesday at
Boston City Hospital of injuries suffered in Tuesday night's jump
to mark the grand opening of WaterWorks, an entertainment complex
at Marina Bay in nearby Quincy.
</p><p>
   Sayles, 41, suffered severe head injuries when he landed on an
embankment by the Savin Hill Yacht Club parking lot, a mile short
of the chutists' target across Dorchester Bay.
</p><p>
   A second chutist, James Bozarth, of Henderson, Nev., was in
stable condition at Boston City Hospital last night. The other two
 A;N;D;MD;  Thomas LaRochelle of Brookline, N.H., and George Head of Las
Vegas  A;N;D;MD;  landed unhurt in the water behind the yacht club.
</p><p>
   The accident left many wondering Wednesday what went wrong. Some
sources suggested the parachutists had been dropped at the wrong
spot. And the pilot pointed to winds bounced from Boston
skyscrapers as a possible explanation.
</p><p>
   Randy Komich, a club member, who helped pull Head from the
water, said it was ``definitely too windy'' for the jump and also
said he thinks the parachutists were ``badly dropped''  A;N;D;MD;  that is,
too far from their destination.
</p><p>
   Donald Mayer, 49, who piloted the Cessna 182A vintage 1952
aircraft modified for skydiving, said that from his vantage point
the jump appeared to be ``excellent.'' Mayer, a parachuter with
1,500 jumps who works for Pepperell Skydiving Center, said there is
no way he could have confused the marina locations.
</p><p>
   ``When you are looking from the air, there is no doubt where you
are,'' said Mayer, who recalled seeing lights of the Marina Bay
parking lot and people gathering for the exhibition. ``It's pretty
precise.''
</p><p>
   Richard Feeney, president and owner of a rival group, The Flying
Elvi in Las Vegas, said the wind conditions should have stopped the
jump. ``The Flying Elvi would never have jumped in those high wind
conditions,'' he said.
</p><p>
   But Glenn Bangs, director of safety and training with the United
States Parachute Association, said weather conditions were ``well
within limits.'' He also said licensed divers are not barred from
jumping in strong winds  A;N;D;MD;  no matter how high. ``It appears as if it
was safe for them to jump,'' Bangs said, adding that Sayles was the
23d member of the USPA to die in an accident this year.
</p><p>
   The National Weather Service said winds were blowing to the
southeast at 15 m.p.h. with gusts up to 23 m.p.h. at 9 p.m. A
service spokesman said surface wind measurements do not reflect how
strong winds thousands of feet up might have been.
</p><p>
   Mayer said the plane left suburban Norwood Airport about 8 p.m.
and hovered over Dorchester Bay about 8:15 p.m., Mayer said.
</p><p>
   He said a wind drift indicator  A;N;D;MD;  a fluorescent yellow crepe
paper 10 inches by 20 feet  A;N;D;MD;  was dropped from the plane to
determine where the plane should position itself for the chutists
to make the target  A;N;D;MD;  the parking lot of Marina Bay.
</p><p>
   Mayer said the indicator landed within a mile of the target,
making it a good condition for a jump. The plane climbed to 5,000
feet and the chutists prepared to jump, patting each other on the
back, wishing each other a safe jump.
</p><p>
   ``I looked down at that point and their exit point was exactly
where it should have been,'' Mayer said. ``I was thinking: `They're
going to have an excellent jump.''
</p><p>
   Mayer said he did not see the jumpers land because he had to
return to Norwood airport and was stunned when he learned of the
mishap. He said winds near cities can be unpredictable.
</p><p>
   ``Windshear could be one of the factors,'' Mayer said. ``If you
were in the ocean, you would have a steady wind ... In Boston, the
wind bounces off skyscrapers and the smoothness of the wind is
disrupted. Even as far as Quincy wind is disrupted. We judge the
best we can.''
</p><p>
   Wednesday the FAA began its probe. ``They will look at any
violation of regulations,'' said FAA spokeswoman Arlene Salac.
</p><p>
   Federal aviation regulations prohibit parachuting between sunset
and sunrise unless the jumper is equipped with a light that is
visible for three miles. The regulations also oversee the packing
of parachutes and whether parachutists can jump over densely
settled areas or in controlled airspace.
</p><p>
   Salac said the jumpers had obtained appropriate permits to jump
in the restricted airspace, known as the Terminal Control Area, a
20-mile diameter around Boston's Logan Airport.
</p><p>
   ``Everything was fine with the waiver,'' Salac said, ``so they
will be looking at the chutes.''
</p><p>
   Ed Kane, president of Eating Up the Coast, the parent company of
WaterWorks, said the jumpers were paid $8,500 and the contract
allowed them to call it off if they deemed it dangerous for weather
reasons. ``It was their call,'' he said.
</p><p>
   Phil Cocco, director of operations for Eating Up the Coast,
added: ``We handled every single possible thing we were supposed
to. We told them: `Don't jump if you don't want to jump.' ''
</p><p>
   Kelly Smith, manager of the Honeymoon group, was unavailable for
comment Wednesday.

CHARLES TAYLOR, 101, HELPED DESIGN LINDBERGH'S ENGINE
(bl)
By DAVID STOUT
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Charles Fayette Taylor, an engineer who was one of the last
living links to the Wright brothers era of aviation and helped to
design the engine for the plane that carried Charles A. Lindbergh
across the Atlantic, died June 22 at his home in Weston, Mass. He
was 101.
</p><p>
   Taylor was on the faculty at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology from 1926 until his retirement in 1960. His two-volume
text, ``The Internal Combustion Engine in Theory and Practice,''
written several decades ago, remains a primary reference for
automotive engineers, MIT said in announcing his death.
</p><p>
   In the early 1920s, just after graduating from Yale University
with a degree in mechanical engineering and while in charge of the
Army's Air Service Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, Taylor was
introduced to Orville Wright.
</p><p>
   Soon he was working for Wright Aeronautical Corp., where he was
in charge of airplane-engine design and development from 1923 to
1926. He was on the team that designed the air-cooled Whirlwind
engine for The Spirit of St. Louis, the craft built by Ryan
Airlines of San Diego for Lindbergh's New-York-to-Paris flight in
1927.
</p><p>
   Knowing full well that his life depended on the engine (and his
ability to stay awake for the 33 and a half hours of the flight),
Lindbergh fussed over its assembly. According to one account, a
mechanic accidentally cracked a cooling fin. Not content to have
the single fin replaced, Lindbergh wanted a whole new section of
engine.
</p><p>
   ``Why?'' the mechanic asked.
</p><p>
   ``Because I don't swim so well,'' Lindbergh replied.
</p><p>
   On the trip east before the trans-Atlantic flight, the engine
coughed a bit over the Rocky Mountains. More ominously, it was
running 1.5 percent below full power on the wet, chilly morning of
May 20, 1927, as Lindbergh revved it on a Long Island airfield,
mulling whether to take off for Paris.
</p><p>
   One last check showed everything in order. Mechanics figured the
engine was being momentarily slowed by the elements.
</p><p>
   The plane took off and the engine worked just fine, even through
1,000 miles of snow and sleet over the ocean.
</p><p>
   As a boy in New York City and in Montclair, N.J., where his
family moved when he was 11, Charles Taylor was fascinated by
airplanes. His drawings were like blueprints, his mother recalled
years later.
</p><p>
   In 1912, he entered Yale, receiving a bachelor's degree in
philosophy in 1915. In World War I, he was an inspector of aircraft
material for the Signal Corps for three months before being put in
charge of the Navy's Aeronautical Engine Laboratory in Washington.
He returned to Yale after the war and received an engineering
degree in 1920.
</p><p>
   Taylor joined MIT as an associate professor of aeronautical
engineering in 1926. Three years later, he was a full professor and
head of aeronautical engineering. In 1933, he was named professor
of mechanical engineering and director of the new Sloan Laboratory
for Aircraft and Automotive Engines, a post he held until his
retirement in 1960.
</p><p>
   In 1988, Taylor and his wife, Alice, were honored for creating
the Educational Counseling Committee of Boston in the late 1940s
and helping more than 2,000 black children attend college.
</p><p>
   Just before his 100th birthday, on Sept. 24, 1994, he was asked
what it meant to live a century. ``I saw Halley's Comet twice,'' he
replied. He had, in 1910 and 1986.
</p><p>
   Surviving are his wife, who is 98; a son, Philip, of San Carlos,
Calif.; seven grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren. Another
son, Charles Jr., died three years ago.

RUDDER SWINGS MAY HAVE CAUSED CRASHES OF 737S
(lb)
By MATTHEW L. WALD
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  Air-safety investigators struggling with two
unsolved crashes of Boeing 737s said Tuesday that an incident
involving another 737 last month could provide important clues.
</p><p>
   In the incident last month, the plane unexpectedly rolled to one
side after a movement by the rudder that the pilot did not ask for
 A;N;D;MD;  the same sequence that investigators believe happened in
September 1994 to USAir Flight 427, which crashed on its approach
to Pittsburgh, killing all 132 aboard.
</p><p>
   The same sequence may have also happened in March 1991 to a
United Airlines 737 that crashed as it was approaching Colorado
Springs, killing all 25 aboard.
</p><p>
   Like the two planes that crashed, the aircraft in last month's
incident, a 25-year-old Boeing 737 belonging to a small new
carrier, Eastwind Airlines, carried a primitive flight-data
recorder that did not capture many details of the incident. The
plane was bought from USAir and is still maintained by that
airline.
</p><p>
   Since the Pittsburgh crash, the National Transportation Safety
Board has been studying all ``uncommanded roll'' incidents in 737s,
in which one of the wings dips unexpectedly. Investigators have
looked at more than 50 such incidents, but this is the first since
the Pittsburgh crash that they cannot explain.
</p><p>
   Late on June 9, in calm, clear weather as the plane was
approaching Richmond, Va., on a flight from the airline's
headquarters in Trenton, N.J., the pilot felt what he described as
a ``bump'' on the rudder, and then a more substantial swing as the
plane rolled to the right.
</p><p>
   The captain told the investigators that he ``stood on the
opposite rudder pedal'' to try to correct the roll, and extended
the ailerons  A;N;D;MD;  the flight-control panels on the wing surfaces  A;N;D;MD; 
nearly all the way. The plane landed without injury to the 48
passengers and crew of five.
</p><p>
   In the Pittsburgh case the flight-data recorder and cockpit
voice recorder do not make clear what happened, but engineers say
the plane's trajectory could be explained by a sudden swing of the
rudder all the way to one side.
</p><p>
   Engineers still do not know what could have made the rudder
swing that way, but they believe that the problem may be centered
on the standby rudder actuator, which is the only part of the
rudder assembly on the Eastwind plane that was not replaced as they
dealt with a series of problems in May and June.
</p><p>
   On new planes, flight-data recorders generally track more than
100 different kinds of data, but the one on the Eastwind plane
tracks only 11, as did the Pittsburgh plane.
</p><p>
   In a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration, James Hall,
the chairman of the safety board, said, ``Under slightly different
circumstances, the Eastwind incident could have become a third
fatal B-737 upset accident for which there was inadequate
flight-data recorder information to determine the cause.''
</p><p>
   The letter, sent on Monday and made public Tuesday, noted that
the board had asked on Feb. 22, 1995, that such recorders be
installed by the end of last year.
</p><p>
   The safety board had asked for immediate action on early 737s
and improvements over a longer period on other old planes. The FAA
combined the two recommendations and drafted a single proposed
rule.
</p><p>
   In a statement Tuesday afternoon the agency said it agreed with
the intent of the safety board's recommendations on flight-data
recorders and was still working on a proposal.
</p><p>
   Airlines have complained that wiring their planes to capture
additional data, like the position of the rudder and the position
of the rudder-control pedals in the cockpit, would mean taking them
out of revenue-producing service for long periods.
</p><p>
   The accidents are particularly troubling because more than 2,400
Boeing 737s are in use.
</p><p>
   According to the safety board, the Eastwind plane had three
earlier problems with its rudder. Shortly before the June 10
incident, most of the critical parts of the rudder-control system
had been replaced, except for a part called the standby rudder
actuator.
</p><p>
   This is normally used only in back-up mode and is part of the
yaw damper, an automatic system that swings the rudder up to 3
degrees in either direction to keep the plane pointed in the
direction it is traveling.
</p><p>
   The yaw damper may have been ``misrigged,'' Hall's letter said,
and could have pushed the rudder up to 4.5 degrees.
</p><p>
   Standby rudder actuators have been known to stick if metal parts
inside rub together and metal from the softer surface accumulates.
But Boeing Co. and others have insisted until now that such a
failure cannot cause the rudder to bend by more than 3 degrees.
</p><p>
   In this case, apparently because of a maintenance error, instead
of having 3 degrees of movement to either side, it was 1.5 degrees
to one side and 4.5 to the other. This is the first time
investigators have found a mechanism for a swing of more than 3
degrees, but both planes evidently experienced an even larger
rudder movement.

   NEW YORK  A;N;D;MD;  A Trans World Airlines 747 bound for Paris from New
York City plunged in a fireball into the waters off Long Island on
Wednesday night with more than 200 people aboard.
</p><p>
   The Coast Guard said there were no survivors, and officials said
there was no immediate indication of what caused the crash.
</p><p>
   The plane, Flight 800, went down at around 8:45 p.m., on a
partly cloudy night minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy
International Airport. It crashed about 20 miles from the airport
and sank into the waters off Moriches Inlet near Center Moriches in
Suffolk County on the eastern end of Long Island, the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey said.
</p><p>
   The Coast Guard said there were 249 passengers and a crew of 32
aboard the flight, which was scheduled to leave Kennedy at 7 p.m.
and was expected to arrive at Charles DeGaulle Airport in Paris at
8:15 on Thursday morning. However, TWA said there were 229 people
aboard. The plane had come in from Athens as Flight 881.
</p><p>
   Witnesses spoke of a light dropping swiftly from the sky and
then either one or two bursts of flame and an enormous black cloud.
As the plane spiraled toward the water, they said they saw pieces
peel off.
</p><p>
   ``There were two explosions, bright red up in the air,'' said
John Keshal, who lives right along the shore in Center Moriches.
``There was a lot of flames and redness in the air. And a lot of
smoke. A lot of smoke.''
</p><p>
   He said he didn't actually see anything resembling an airplane,
but ``two separate red areas coming out of the sky.''
</p><p>
   Even several hours after the crash, debris from the plane could
be seen burning in the water as rescue boats surrounded it.
</p><p>
   Jackie Marlow, who lives in East Moriches and had been fishing
in Moriches Inlet, said, ``There was a great fire, like a fireball.
Eventually the plane just spread apart, and there was a loud thump.
I felt the tremor when it hit the water.''
</p><p>
   Debbie Walsh, who was at a restaurant within view of the crash,
said, ``It looked like a ball of fire falling into the water. It
was a ball of fire and then the plane trailed down and seemed to
break into two pieces.'' She added, ``It was trails of flame going
down to the water.''
</p><p>
   People on pleasure boats in the general vicinity of the crash
reported seeing bodies bobbing in the water alongside fragments of
the plane still on fire.
</p><p>
   The plunging ball of fire was apparently visible as far away as
Dune Road in Westhampton Beach, and people said they could feel the
shock wave 10 to 12 miles from the crash.
</p><p>
   ``We are not finding any survivors,'' Coast Guard Chief Petty
Officer Steve Sapp was quoted by The Associated Press as saying.
``We are locating lots of bodies out there.''
</p><p>
   Coast Guard and Navy planes dropped life rafts in the waters
shortly after the crash. The Coaat Guard said that six helicopters,
three cutters and a Navy P-3 plane were dispatched to the scene.
</p><p>
   On the beaches fronting the inlet, a temporary morgue was set up
by rescue officials.
</p><p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration would not confirm that there
was an explosion, saying only that it lost radar contact with the
aircraft at 8:45 p.m. The plane was under the control of the Boston
Air Traffic Control Center.
</p><p>
   The possibility that there was an explosion aboard the plane
raised the obvious possibility that terrorism was involved, and
federal law-enforcement officials said they were looking into that
possibility. But there are other possible causes for an explosion
as well, such as a problem with an engine, and it may be weeks or
even months before a final determination is made.
</p><p>
   If terrorism was involved, the FBI would have jurisdiction over
the investigation into the cause of the blast.
</p><p>
   But the officials cautioned that they had no definitive evidence
suggesting what caused the downing of the plane, and said that it
would probably be many hours before they got a clear fix on what
happened. One federal official, however, said, ``It doesn't look
good,'' meaning that the circumstances seemed to point to a
terrorist act.
</p><p>
   The FBI was mobilizing agents on Wednesday night from its New
York field office to help identify victims and to work with the FAA
to help determine the cause of the crash.
</p><p>
   Ira Furman, a former investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board, urged caution about early reports of
explosions. ``We have found reports of explosions unreliable,'' he
said. ``I can suggest that sometimes an explosion is really
connected with a flameout, like a backfire in a car.''
</p><p>
   The National Transportation Safety Board said that a team from
its New Jersey office was securing the beaches bordering the waters
where the crash occurred. An additional team from Washington was
expected to arrive at the site on Thursday morning.
</p><p>
   The aircraft, a 747 Model 100, is the world's first jumbo jet
and was flown for the first time in 1969. The 100 designation makes
it one of the older 747 models. It is 232 feet long, with a
wingspan of 196 feet. The plane can cruise at 600 miles and hour,
with a range of nearly 760 miles.
</p><p>
   The aircraft can be configured to carry as many as 516
passengers, although it was unclear how many people the plane that
crashed was set up to contain.
</p><p>
   The plane had come in from Athens as Flight 881.
</p><p>
   The FAA said the plane had climbed to 13,000 feet before it
disappeared from the radar screen.
</p><p>
   The FBI sent counterterrorism investigators to the scene, which
is normally done in instances where there is a possibility of an
attack.

TWA CRASH CAUSE PROBED; COMPANY RECEIVED NO THREATS (UPDATE1)

<p>
   New York, July 18 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. investigators continued to
probe what caused a Trans World Airlines Inc. jumbo jet to explode
and plummet into the Atlantic Ocean with 228 people aboard last
night. There were no reports of survivors. CNN reported that about
100 bodies have been found.
</p><p>
   Officials said they haven't ruled out terrorism as a cause of
the blast on the Boeing 747-100 jet, which came after TWA
heightened security as a precaution ahead of the Olympic Games in
Atlanta.
</p><p>
   ``We have no reason to believe that there was a threat against
the aircraft,'' Mark Abels, a TWA spokesman, said at a press
conference. He also said the company doesn't believe there were any
problems with the aircraft.
</p><p>
   Abels said TWA wouldn't release a complete list of passengers
until all family members were notified. He said there were 210
passengers on board. The rest were flight attendants and crew.
</p><p>
   President Clinton warned Americans not to jump to conclusions
about the cause of the crash.
</p><p>
   ``We do not know what caused this tragedy,'' Clinton said.
``Let's wait until we see the evidence. We will find out what
happened.''
</p><p>
   Eyewitnesses described a series of explosions before the plane
fell.
</p><p>
   The navy was sending a crew to retrieve the plane's black boxes,
which could be about 100 feet under water, said House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt. The crash site is about 20 miles off New
York's Long Island.
</p><p>
   New York Representative Michael Forbes, speaking near the crash
site, said he was told divers had retrieved one of the two black
boxes.
</p><p>
   Search teams retrieved passengers' belongings and parts of the
engine, wings and a 30-foot piece of the fuselage.
</p><p>
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is leading the investigation
into whether the explosion was ``the result of criminal activity,''
James Hall, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, told CNN.
</p><p>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said the FBI was looking into two
suspicious telephone calls made after the crash that may have been
related to the TWA crash.
</p><p>
   TWA Flight 800, bound for Paris, disappeared from radar screens
around 8:40 p.m. local time shortly after taking off from New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport. Among the passengers was a party of
16 teenagers from a Pennsylvania high school.
</p><p>
   Experts say the maximum survival period in the Atlantic Ocean at
65 degrees Fahrenheit is 12 hours.
</p><p>
   Abels, the TWA spokesman, said the plane was delayed about an
hour because of confusion over a passenger's luggage and the
breakdown of a piece of ground equipment that had to be towed from
the runway.
</p><p>
   The 25-year-old Boeing aircraft was bound for Paris's Charles de
Gaulle Airport. The plane had flown earlier yesterday from Athens,
Greece, to New York.
</p><p>
   Takis Tassopoulous, the head of Greek aviation security, told
CNN that his office had no warnings of terrorist activity in
Athens.
</p><p>
   TWA released the names of some crew members. These included
Capt. Steve Snyder, a TWA pilot since 1964; Richard Campell, flight
engineer; and Oliver Krick, recently hired by TWA and on the plane
as an observer as part of his flight engineer training.
</p><p>
   The crash comes two months after a ValuJet Inc. plane exploded
and crashed in the Florida Everglades, killing all 110 people
aboard. That plane was a McDonnell Douglas Corp. DC-9.
Atlanta-based ValuJet was grounded by the Federal Aviation
Administration one month after the crash.
</p><p>
   David Stempler, an aviation consultant in Washington, D.C., said
the FAA, already under fire for its monitoring of ValuJet, will
face tough questions about its safety regulations as a result of
the latest crashes.
</p><p>
   Passengers will have a ``you better get it right this time''
attitude toward both the airlines and the agency, Stempler said.
</p><p>
   A U.S. airliner has never been brought down with a bomb planted
in the U.S. A terrorist bomb that blew up a Pan Am flight over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988 originated in Germany, hidden
in a cassette player.
</p><p>
   The crash comes less than a year after St. Louis-based TWA
emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the airline's second
bankruptcy filing in two years.
</p><p>
   The carrier has become competitive again by paring costs and
pulling out of money-losing routes. The 72-year-old carrier earlier
on Wednesday reported an almost fivefold increase in second-quarter
net income to $25.3 million, or 46 cents a share.
</p><p>
   TWA has had a good safety record, industry analysts say.
</p><p>
   The plane that crashed was bought in 1971, a Boeing spokesman
said. Boeing produced that model of the world's largest airliner
from 1970 through 1986. It holds about 360 passengers in three
classes.
</p><p>
   ``It's too soon to get any hard data on what happened,'' said
Boeing spokesman Doug Webb. ``We will cooperate fully with any
investigation.''
</p><p>
   All Boeing 747-100 planes use Pratt A;N;D;AMP; Whitney JT9D engines, said
Mark Sullivan, a spokesman for Pratt A;N;D;AMP; Whitney, which is a unit of
United Technologies Corp. Sullivan said the engine, in use since
1970, hasn't experienced any problems ``that would be considered
out of the ordinary for airline operations.''
</p><p>
   Pratt A;N;D;AMP; Whitney has sent a crash investigator to the site,
Sullivan said.
</p><p>
   TWA shares fell 1 to 10 1/4 in midafternoon trading of 5.2
million shares, far more than the three-month daily average of
885,700 shares.
</p><p>
   Boeing shares rose 1 5/8 to 86 7/8, while United Technologies
gained 2 3/4 to 107 3/4.
</p><p>
   Brian Jenkins, vice chairman of the international security firm
Kroll Associates, said airport security measures have improved
significantly in recent years, in the wake of terrorist attacks.
</p><p>
   ``As the result of extraordinary security measures, commercial
aviation, which was once one of the most popular targets of
international terrorism, was made a more difficult target,'' he
said.
</p><p>
   He said attempts to hijack or plant bombs aboard aircraft have
decreased. Deaths in crashes, however, have increased markedly this
year, according to Flight International magazine, to 609 in the
first six months from 206 in the same period last year.
</p><p>
   A toll-free number has been set up for family members of people
on the flight. The number is (800) 438-9892.

AVIATION EXPERTS POINT TO TERRORISM AS LIKELY CAUSE OF CRASH
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE
c.1996 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  Aviation experts pointed Thursday to a terrorist
attack as the most likely cause of the explosion and fiery crash of
a TWA jumbo jet into the Atlantic Ocean off New York's Long Island.
</p><p>
   But they did not rule out mechanical failure, such as the
explosion of one of the four engines on the Boeing 747-100, and
President Clinton warned against snap conclusions.
</p><p>
   ``I want to caution the American people we have no evidence ...
that would indicate the cause of the accident,'' Clinton said.
</p><p>
   ``And I want to remind you that when we had the terrible tragedy
in Oklahoma City, a lot of people immediately concluded that this
must have been done by some force outside our country, and it
appears that that was not the case now.''
</p><p>
   But aviation and terrorism experts said eyewitness accounts and
information so far available on the crash of TWA Flight 800 point
to a bomb as the cause.
</p><p>
   ``It appears to have been an instantaneous, huge explosion,''
said William Lawrence, a Fort Worth aviation expert and former
Marine Corps pilot who investigated aviation accidents for the
Navy. ``If I had to bet, I would bet it was a bomb.''
</p><p>
   Among the reasons for that conclusion:
</p><p>
   Eyewitnesses seem to say unanimously that the Paris-bound plane
plunged into the Atlantic in a ball of fire.
</p><p>
   The wreckage, judging from pictures available through the media,
was in small pieces, a sign of the explosive force of a bomb.
</p><p>
   The Boeing 747, despite some high-profile mishaps, is considered
one of the world's safest aircraft.
</p><p>
   The crash came two days before this evening's opening of the
Olympic Games in Atlanta, a factor that might have figured in
terrorists' planning if they were indeed behind the crash.
</p><p>
   MSNBC, the new interactive news service from Microsoft Corp. and
NBC News, reported late Thursday on the World Wide Web that
investigators were looking at radar tapes to examine ``possible
activity outside the 747 when it went down.''
</p><p>
   The tapes may reveal another object, possibly a missile,
collided with the plane, the report said.
</p><p>
   But Lawrence acknowledged that there could be several possible
causes for the crash.
</p><p>
   ``If an engine did come apart, it may have sent a hot piece
through a fuel tank,'' Lawrence said. ``It could also have been
carrying some kind of hazardous cargo that would have caused an
explosion.''
</p><p>
   Oxygen generators carried as cargo aboard a ValuJet DC-9 have
been cited as a probable cause of the plane's crash on May 11 in
the Florida Everglades. All 110 people on board were killed.
</p><p>
   Lawrence said it was unusual for TWA Flight 800 to have
disappeared from radar screens with no emergency communications
from the crew.
</p><p>
   TWA officials said the plane left Kennedy Airport at 7:19 p.m.
CDT and disappeared by 7:48 p.m. with ``no non-routine
transmissions.''
</p><p>
   The crash was reminiscent of the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 on
Dec. 21, 1988. The Boeing 747 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland,
less than an hour into its flight from London to New York. No
distress signals were received from its crew and witnesses reported
seeing fireballs in the sky.
</p><p>
   Within hours of the Pan Am crash, investigators suspected a
bomb. The plane exploded suddenly at 31,000 feet and an Iranian
group claimed responsibility. Federal officials had been cautioned
that a Pan Am flight on the Frankfurt-New York route was a target
for bombing.
</p><p>
   Investigators later found that the bomb was made of plastic
explosive hidden in a radio-cassette recorder in a suitcase. That
bomb was triggered by a device set for a specific altitude.
</p><p>
   Robert Louden, a terrorism expert at the John Jay College in New
York, said several signs point to terrorism in the TWA crash, but
that so far there is no hard evidence.
</p><p>
   He noted that the FBI immediately dispatched members of its
explosives unit to New York. The agents should be able to determine
if an explosive device was used by looking for residue of explosive
material on debris and even on the bodies of victims.
</p><p>
   ``Because of the possibility of terrorism, you absolutely have
to start looking right away,'' Louden said. ``If it does turn out
to be that, you haven't lost time or potential evidence.''
</p><p>
   But Louden said the crash could have been caused by someone
without political motives.
</p><p>
   ``It could be man-caused, but not terrorist related,'' he said.
``There could be some other motivation for someone wanting to
accomplish the same end. There are any number of motivating
factors: terrorism, suicide, insurance, and it could have been just
one person bent on any of the above.''
</p><p>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said two telephone calls from people
claiming responsibility were received after the plane went down.
</p><p>
   Television station WTSP in Tampa, Fla., received a call at about
2:45 Thursday morning from someone whom station officials said
claimed to be a member of a Jihad, or ``holy war.'' The station
notified Tampa police and the FBI.
</p><p>
   But Louden said it is not unusual for a group, or pranksters, to
take credit for a deadly event after the fact.
</p><p>
   ``Often, it is one group trying to get their name in the ring,''
he said.

EXPLOSION OF TWA FLIGHT 800 SPREADS PALL OVER AIRLINE'S OVERHAUL
BASE

<p>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo.  A;N;D;MD;  The deadly explosion of TWA Flight 800 spread
a pall over the airline's Kansas City overhaul base Thursday.
</p><p>
   ``We lost a lot of good people on that airplane,'' Roger Tyler,
a base mechanic, said as he sat at nearby Allie's Bar A;N;D;AMP; Grill after
his work shift ended Thursday afternoon. ``It's heart saddening.''
</p><p>
   Federal Aviation Administration records show that the jet that
crashed near New York paid what were considered routine visits to
the base, the airline's primary site for plane maintenance.
</p><p>
   Base workers said they and their colleagues wore Walkman radios
much of the work day, listening for word of what ignited the 747
explosion.
</p><p>
   The cause of the crash was unknown, and that uncertainty grated
on the beefy, bearded Tyler.
</p><p>
   ``I would hate to think that this was maintenance,'' he said
over the muted babblings of a TV talk show. ``As long as I've
worked at TWA, I've never seen bad maintenance. Everybody's so
conscientious. The training takes years. It's not something you go
to night school for.''
</p><p>
   Other TWA workers at the bar described the mood at the base as
``pretty somber.''
</p><p>
   Steve Lacy, a mechanic who has worked at the base nearly 30
years, was subdued and somewhat stoic about the tragedy.
</p><p>
   ``I'm sorry for all those people that got killed,'' Lacy said.
``It's just one of those things. It could have been a bomb or
anything. You don't know what happened....There's nothing else I
can do.''
</p><p>
   Kathy Woodward, a bartender and waitress at the Final Approach
Pub near the base, said she served fewer TWA employees than normal
Thursday.
</p><p>
   ``The (TWA) people I had today were very down,'' Woodward said
amid the bar's vast collection of airline memorabilia. ``They were
glued to the TV. People were not themselves.''
</p><p>
   Tyler, who overhauls pumps that move fuel from the wings to the
engine, said working on aircraft is a high-pressure job, ``probably
right below being a doctor.''
</p><p>
   ``We take people's lives in our hands,'' he said. ``We don't
take it lightly. I'll stand behind every pump I ever build. When I
go home to sleep tonight, I'll know that isn't what caused that
crash.''
</p><p>
   Tyler insisted that the crash wouldn't impede TWA's financial
recovery after years of losses: ``We're coming back, and everybody
knows we're coming back.''
</p><p>
   Mechanics and other rank-and-file workers at the base belong to
Machinists Local 1650, which is overseen by Machinists District
142. Gary Poos, a District 142 official, said the union is ``fully
participating in this investigation.''
</p><p>
   Poos said William O'Driscoll, president of District 142, was at
the command post in New York.
</p><p>
   Poos said the union's ``deepest sympathy goes to the families
and friends of those who perished in this tragedy.''

EXPERTS SKEPTICAL THAT A STINGER MISSILE DOWNED TWA JET
(For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
By HOLLY YEAGER
c.1996 Hearst Newspapers
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  Weapons experts said Friday it's unlikely that a
Stinger surface-to-air missile brought down TWA Flight 800.
</p><p>
   Paul Beaver, a spokesman for Jane's Information Group Limited,
publishers of books on weapons, noted a lack of evidence that any
missile was involved in the Wednesday night explosion and crash of
the Boeing 747.
</p><p>
   Beaver also expressed skepticism that a hand-held U.S.-made
Stinger anti-aircraft missile could have downed the jumbo jet.
</p><p>
   Some eyewitnesses said they saw a bright light moving toward the
jet just before it exploded over the Atlantic Ocean shortly after
it had taken off from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, leading
to speculation that a missile may have been responsible. TWA said
230 passengers and crew were killed in the incident.
</p><p>
   However, Beaver said several factors make him think the weapon
``couldn't possibly have been used.''
</p><p>
   For one thing, the Stinger's maximum altitude is about 12,400
feet, while the TWA jet exploded at an altitude of around 13,700,
he noted.
</p><p>
   Furthermore, the missile has a maximum range of about 2.8 miles,
while the TWA plane was about 10 miles offshore. The missile would
have to have been fired from a boat, a still more difficult
maneuver.
</p><p>
   In addition, Beaver said batteries used in the missiles have
only a 10-year life and may have failed by now.
</p><p>
   ``You need to be an expert to operate it,'' he said. ``You need
to smuggle it into the United States or to have obtained it
illegally in the United States,'' he added.
</p><p>
   Noting that a shoulder-fired Stinger, including its heat-seeking
missile and launcher, weighs about 44 pounds and is 60 inches long,
Beaver called it ``a conspicuous piece of merchandise.''
</p><p>
   Arms control experts have been concerned about an estimated
1,000 Stinger missiles the United States shipped to Afghan rebels
in the late 1980s to help them shoot down Soviet helicopters.
</p><p>
   After the war, several hundred unused Stingers began spreading
to other countries and terrorist groups. A CIA effort with a
reported budget of $55 million to buy back the missiles has been
largely unsuccessful, instead boosting the black-market price of
the $30,000 missiles to more than $100,000, experts say.
</p><p>
   William D. Hartung, a specialist in the global arms market at
the New School for Social Research, called the spread of the
U.S.-made Stingers ``a case of unintended consequences.''
</p><p>
   The United States provided the weapons to the anti-communist
Afghan mujahedeen ``for one purpose, ejecting the Soviets, but they
didn't think about the character of the movement that they were
giving it to, which was a right-wing fundamentalist Islamic
movement which was involved in training Islamic fighters from all
over the world,'' he said.
</p><p>
   While that helps explain how the Stingers originally shipped to
Afghanistan spread to terrorist groups throughout the world,
Hartung said it's ``unbelievable that someone could park themselves
on Long Island with a Stinger missile and take out an airliner.''
</p><p>
   Natalie J. Goldring, deputy director of the British American
Security Information Council, a non-profit research group, also
expressed skepticism that a Stinger was responsible.
</p><p>
   ``I think we've been lucky,'' Goldring said. ``I am one of those
people who has been saying for a long time that this is the sort of
system that can come back to haunt us.''
</p><p>
   Goldring said ``every Stinger that is in another country's hands
is a Stinger that can be used against civilian aircraft.''
</p><p>
   But she, too, said she thinks it's unlikely that a Stinger was
used to down the jumbo jet. ``The more that advanced technology is
used in a system, the shorter its shelf life tends to be,'' she
said.
</p><p>
   While pistols from World War I can still be found in working
order, ``advanced portable surface-to-air missiles are a lot more
complicated,'' she said.
</p><p>
   Terrorism expert Neil Livingstone said it's too early to rule
out any explanation for the explosion, but he said a missile
appears unlikely. On the other hand, he said, at least a dozen
terrorist groups have surface-to-air missiles.
</p><p>
   While Pentagon officials have discounted reports that radar
showed a small object approaching the plane just before it
exploded, Beaver said a missile like the Stinger wouldn't
necessarily show up on radar.
</p><p>
   John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists said that
even if the TWA plane was outside the range of a Stinger, ``that
would by no means rule out this thing being done by a
surface-to-air missile,'' other than a Stinger, perhaps fired from
a boat.
</p><p>
   ``There are other man-portable missiles ... that have a
significantly longer range,'' including the Russian SA-7 Grail
anti-aircraft missile, Pike said.
</p><p>
   Goldring said the mere speculation that a U.S.-made weapon may
have been responsible for the explosion will bring attention to
U.S. arms export policy.
</p><p>
   ``I think we need to think much more carefully about what kinds
of weapons we are supplying, especially to unstable and
undemocratic regimes,'' she said. ``The risks are just too high.''

SEAMAN KEEPS THINKING OF STUFFED TWEETIE BIRD FISHED FROM WATER
(For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
By BENNETT ROTH
c.1996 Houston Chronicle
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   EAST MORICHES, N.Y.  A;N;D;MD;  Tom Coonan had been at sea less than two
days when his U.S. Coast Guard cutter was forced by rough weather
to abandon its search Friday for the remains of TWA Flight 800.
</p><p>
   On his way back to port, the 19-year-old seaman kept thinking
about the four-foot, stuffed Tweetie Bird he had fished from the
water.
</p><p>
   ``I thought about a little kid sitting near his mom holding that
bird,'' he said. ``And then, it's over.''
</p><p>
   For Coonan and 10 other crew members of the Coast Guard cutter
Point Wells, the past two days have been unsettling. Their vessel,
once a patrol boat in Vietnam, was one of the first to arrive off
eastern Long Island early Thursday, just hours after the
Paris-bound Boeing 747 exploded and plunged into the Atlantic.
</p><p>
   ``You could smell it in the air. You knew something had
happened,'' said Coonan, a Vermont native.
</p><p>
   ``It was eerie when you know what's out there,'' said Chris
Biswurm, 23, another Point Wells crewman. ``We were just out there
steaming through this stuff.''
</p><p>
   Donald Kreesim, a senior chief petty officer, said he had tried
to prepare his young crew for what he knew would be an emotionally
difficult task when the Point Wells left port. He even refused to
let the crew watch television, fearing it might distract them and
make their jobs even harder.
</p><p>
   ``We had a mission to concentrate on,'' said Kreesim, 40.
</p><p>
   Since late Wednesday, the Point Wells and hundreds of other
vessels have scoured the Atlantic off Long Island, looking for
bodies, plane debris and any possessions of the 230 people who
boarded the plane at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.
</p><p>
   Search and rescue efforts were hampered Friday by rain and heavy
seas.
</p><p>
   Waves as high as six feet forced the Coast Guard to recall some
of its smaller boats. Divers, who had been expected to begin their
search for debris on the ocean floor, were unable to get into the
water.
</p><p>
   Officials feared the turbulent water was spreading the debris
and moving some of it into deeper water, which would increase the
difficulty of retrieving bodies and wreckage.
</p><p>
   ``The weather is not playing in our favor,'' said Blair Thomas,
public affairs officer for the Coast Guard.
</p><p>
   On Saturday, the Navy is expected to bring in divers and special
equipment that can be lowered in the water to pick up the
high-pitched signal from the flight data recorders  A;N;D;MD;  the so-called
black boxes  A;N;D;MD;  aboard the aircraft.
</p><p>
   Meanwhile, residents have been reporting pieces of the wreckage
washing ashore.
</p><p>
   Ed O'Connell found a charred tray table, the kind normally
attached to the rear of airplane seats, near his home about 15
miles from the crash site.
</p><p>
   O'Connell, who showed reporters his find, said he figured it was
part of the plane when he noticed the wording ``Life Vest under
your seat'' etched on the tray bottom.
</p><p>
   Meanwhile, those who observed the jumbo jet exploding say they
still have vivid memories. Captain Chris Baur of the New York
International Guard, was flying his helicopter when the plane went
down.
</p><p>
   ``There was an explosion followed by a bigger explosion followed
by a bigger explosion,'' Baur recalled. ``It spiraled down like a
corkscrew until it hit the ocean.''
</p><p>
   Baur said he became aware of the magnitude of the loss when he
sighted as many as 80 bodies in the water.

FBI HASN'T TAKEN OVER TWA PROBE; CAUSE STILL UNKNOWN (UPDATE1)
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By Greg Groeller
c.1996 Bloomberg Business News
   (Adds comments from National Transportation Safety Board's 9
p.m. press conference in 5th-8th and 13th paragraphs.)
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   New York, July 19 (Bloomberg) -- A U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation official said the agency hasn't taken over the probe
of Wednesday's crash of a Trans World Airlines Inc. jet that killed
230 people.
</p><p>
   However, Jim Kallstrom, an investigator with the FBI's
anti-terrorism task force, said the FBI is treating the crash site
as a crime scene in case it later determines a crime was committed.
</p><p>
   Kallstrom said investigators haven't determined the cause and
are considering all possibilities. TWA Flight 800, a Boeing 747,
exploded and plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Long
Island, New York, on Wednesday night.
</p><p>
   ``If it is a terrorist act, we will find the cowards who did
this,'' Kallstrom said at a press conference near the crash site.
</p><p>
   The FBI hasn't delayed blaming the crash on a terrorist act due
to pressure from the White House over the timing of the opening of
the Olympic games, Kallstrom said in a second press conference held
Friday evening. ``We're not trying to be cute here. We're not
prepared to say something until we're sure it's absolutely true,''
he said. ``We're not discounting anything.''
</p><p>
   Kallstrom added that it took six days before the December 1988
crash of a Pan Am 747 in Lockerbie, Scotland, was labeled the
result of a bomb.
</p><p>
   He said the FBI is working with overseas criminal investigation
agencies in the probe, which he described as ``massive.''
</p><p>
   The crash is the second-worst in the U.S., after a 1979 American
Airlines crash in Chicago that killed 273.
</p><p>
   The plane went down shortly after taking off from New York's
John F. Kennedy Airport bound for Paris's Charles de Gaulle
Airport. It had flown earlier from Athens, Greece, to New York.
</p><p>
   Earlier today, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Intelligence
Agency confirmed it also is investigating the crash, looking for
clues that might suggest a foreign connection.
</p><p>
   ``We've been involved since the tragedy first occurred,'' said
Mark Mansfield, a CIA spokesman. He said the CIA always looks at
incidents where involvement by a foreign person or group is
possible.
</p><p>
   At the evening press conference, Robert Francis, chairman of the
National Transportation Safety Board, said high winds and rough
seas had forced divers away from a spot at the crash site where a
large piece of the aircraft might be located, according to sonar
readings. This evening he said less than 1 percent of the wreckage
has been recovered so far.
</p><p>
   Earlier, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani again slammed TWA for
taking too long to present victims' families with a list of
confirmed fatalities.
</p><p>
   ``I heard a TWA spokesman say that all the family members had
been notified by noon yesterday,'' Giuliani said. ``That's totally
false. They hadn't even compiled a list by 4 o'clock.''
</p><p>
   Jeff Erickson, TWA's chief executive, responded to a question
about the delay by saying that the airline's trauma response team
had to be assembled from locations all over the country. He said
TWA officials are currently working with family members in New York
and Paris.
</p><p>
   Erickson also said last night's Flight 800 left fully loaded and
that the airline's advance bookings for the summer remain strong.
</p><p>
   TWA shares fell 3/4 to close at 9 1/2 on trading of 3.5 million
shares, much more than the three-month average of 997,100, but less
than half the 7.3 million shares traded Thursday.

BOSNIA GIs SEE THEMSELVES AS LUCKY AFTER BOMB MISHAP
(th)
By MIKE O'CONNOR
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BRCKO, Bosnia-Herzegovina  A;N;D;MD;  While the Navy investigated why one
of its aircraft accidentally dropped a 500-pound bomb on the edge
of a U.S. military base near here, soldiers at the base were asking
similar questions Sunday and counting themselves lucky that there
were no injuries.
</p><p>
   Aside, that is, from damage to the nerves of the some 800
people, most attached to an Army cavalry squadron, who were at the
base on Saturday afternoon when the bomb struck.
</p><p>
   ``We thought war was fixing to break out,'' said Pfc. Carter
Sanders, who with his partner in a watchtower at the base, Camp
McGovern, was probably the closest person to the explosion.
</p><p>
   Pfc. John Raile said, ``People's eyes were all wide trying to
figure out what happened.''
</p><p>
   Some soldiers said they thought that they were under artillery
attack. The base commander, Lt. Col. Tony Cucolo, said he thought
at first that it might be an attack by a renegade pilot from one of
the local Bosnian military forces. Others said they had no idea who
was shooting at them or with what.
</p><p>
   Soldiers said that for about 30 minutes until the situation was
clarified, they dove into bunkers and ran to firing positions
around the base, preparing to fire off mortars and getting ready
for the next step in what was generally thought to be an attack.
</p><p>
   But even the truth was of only limited comfort. Spc. Ronald Orr
said he had thought of soldiers killed by alleid fire during the
1991 Persian Gulf war. He said: ``It makes you think, `Here we go
again.' ''
</p><p>
   Military officials said the bomb fell from a Navy FA-18 jet,
also known as a Hornet, in which the pilot was practicing bombing
runs near the base so as to be able to protect the troops there in
case they came under attack by ground forces.
</p><p>
   The drill did not entail dropping a bomb, only practicing
coordination between the aircraft and controllers on the ground.
But as the jet, which was based on the carrier Enterprise in the
Adriatic, flew over the base, the bomb fell, exploding on a remote
section of a large mound of dirt that runs around most of the base.
</p><p>
   It missed three large freight containers holding ammunition by
about 200 feet.
</p><p>
   About half of the bomb's weight was the metal casing, so 250
pounds of explosive shook the ground, sending concussion waves
against the soldiers and 250 pounds of metal fragments through part
of the base. An Army spokesman said, however, that there was almost
no damage from either the explosion or shrapnel.
</p><p>
   There have been no fatalities as a result of hostile action
among the 16,500 American peacekeepers in Bosnia since they began
arriving in December.
</p><p>
   The base, just southwest of Brcko, is in a particularly tense
area of Bosnia, in the three-mile wide strip of land that separates
Bosnian government and Bosnia Serb territory.
</p><p>
   There has been fairly constant friction between the Muslim and
Serbian authorities here. Last week, three war-damaged houses that
were being rebuilt by their Muslim owners on the Serbian side were
dynamited, presumably by Serbs who did not want the Muslims to
return.
</p><p>
   Four nights ago, base officers said, three men tried to sneak
into the base, prompting a search around the base and the shooting
off of illumination shells. Although the officers said the
intruders probably were only looking for something to steal, the
incident raised anxieties here.
</p><p>
   Sgt. Peter Walker said that on Saturday, while he was trying to
figure out who was behind the explosion, he thought of last month's
bomb attack on the American base in Saudi Arabia and last week's
crash of the TWA airliner off Long Island.
</p><p>
   As he watched the smoke rise from what he described as a very
impressive explosion, Walker said he thought: ``If something like
that hits real near us, we're dead. There's no question.''
</p><p>
   The base is built around a large group of buildings from an
abandoned farm cooperative. The nearest civilian houses are more
than a mile away in the Bosnia Serb side of the dividing line. But
these too are abandoned for the most part. The owners are Muslims
who were expelled during the war, and the homes are too badly
damaged to be habitable.
</p><p>
   But some of the owners are repairing their homes. Sunday, while
the American soldiers were still shaken, Hamdija Mujic leaned
against the bumper of his burned car, which remains in the ruins of
the garage where it was sitting two years ago when an artillery
barrage destroyed his house.
</p><p>
   ``Yeah, we heard the explosion,'' Mujic said, ``but we didn't
think much of it. It was just one bomb. The Americans should
relax.''

<p>
   NEW YORK  A;N;D;MD;  Investigators examining the small amount of wreckage
recovered so far from the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800
said on Tuesday that they had not yet found any concrete evidence
that the plane was destroyed by an explosive device.
</p><p>
   Speaking to reporters on Tuesday evening, President Clinton said
investigators were making progress, but he added: ``We must not
draw conclusions until we're sure the conclusion is supported by
the facts. And I cannot say that I've learned anything today which
enables me to give you a definite conclusion about the cause of the
accident.''
</p><p>
   Law enforcement officials on Long Island continued to maintain
that circumstantial evidence suggested that the 747 jetliner
crashed because of an act of either political terrorism or
sabotage. And they said they expected to have a clearer sense of
what caused the plane to explode last Wednesday night when they
begin recovering large sections of the wreckage, possibly as early
as Wednesday.
</p><p>
   Gov. George Pataki said the first priority was to recover the
``dozens and dozens'' of bodies that divers had found trapped in
large sections of the fuselage resting on the bottom of the ocean.
He estimated that the divers had found 60 to 100 bodies, which
could account for most of the 122 bodies that have not been
recovered.
</p><p>
   Despite Pataki's announcement, there were conflicting statements
from other officials on Tuesday night.
</p><p>
   Robert Francis, the vice-chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said there were no bodies in the wreckage that had
not been recovered.
</p><p>
   But despite Francis' comments, a federal official in East
Moriches, on Long Island, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
confirmed that there were dozens of bodies still on the ocean
floor.
</p><p>
   And early on Wednesday, James Kallstrom, assistant FBI director
for the New York office, said: ``Given the fact that a portion of
the fuselage has been discovered, and that the search team has
apparently located a large debris field in the same area, we have
every hope and expectation of finding and recovering a significant
number of victims soon.''
</p><p>
   The accounts angered family members staying at the Ramada Plaza
Hotel at Kennedy International Airport, who told reporters late on
Tuesday night that they were frustrated by the conflicting
accounts.
</p><p>
   So far, the remains of 108 of the 230 people on board the New
York to Paris flight have been recovered, and 77 bodies have been
identified.
</p><p>
   At the crash site off the coast of Suffolk County on Long
Island, recovery workers brought up three more bodies on Tuesday
and continued sonar mapping of the ocean floor in preparation for
the enormous task of disentangling bodies from the wreckage,
bringing them to the surface and then raising the pieces of the
airplane.
</p><p>
   ``Raising the remains, identifying the bodies is a top
priority,'' Pataki said. ``We believe there will be dozens and
dozens of bodies that will be identified and returned to their
families.''
</p><p>
   The governor said the second task would be to recover the large
pieces of the plane, which he said would help solve the mystery of
what made the airplane explode at an altitude of 13,700 feet
shortly after it took off for Paris.
</p><p>
   Law enforcement officials, who from the beginning suspected that
the plane had been destroyed by an explosive device, said on
Tuesday that further tests for traces of explosives from a piece of
the airplane's wing had not yet produced any evidence of such
traces. On Monday, when law enforcement agents on Long Island
tested a residue found on the underside of the wing segment, they
first found traces of an explosive, but in a later test with
different equipment, no traces were detected.
</p><p>
   On Tuesdayy, when the residue was tested with more sophisticated
equipment at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Va., once again no
explosive traces were found on this or any other piece of wreckage
that had been retrieved.
</p><p>
   ``Right now,'' a senior law enforcement official said, ``we just
don't have enough pieces of metal to make a judgment about the
cause of the crash. Not today and maybe not tomorrow.''
</p><p>
   Even as the crash inquiry remains classified as an accident
investigation, the FBI is investigating various criminal theories.
And Zachary Carter, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
New York, has assigned prosecutors and investigators, led by
Valerie Caproni, head of the criminal division, to monitor the
case.
</p><p>
   Kallstrom, said on Tuesday that the FBI had already conducted
1,300 interviews on the crash. ``We're looking at everybody that
touched that aircraft,'' he said.
</p><p>
   Kallstrom said that two working criminal theories were that the
plane was destroyed by a bomb or a missile and that ``there's
circumstantial evidence pointing in those directions.''
</p><p>
   Kenneth Bacon, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, cast
some doubt on the possibility of a missile. He said that satellite
photographs and radar data offered no evidence of a missile strike
on the plane. He said that apart from the accounts of eyewitnesses
who described a streak of light near the 747 before the explosion,
there was ``precious else'' to suggest that a missile had hit the
plane.
</p><p>
   But he told reporters that the Defense Department and other
federal agencies had left open the possibility of a missile,
possibly fired from a boat. ``Could it have been fired from the
water?'' he said. ``That is the question that they're looking
into.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   A small single-engine plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean
about eight miles off New Jersey on Wednesday. The Coast Guard
reported finding aircraft debris and a fuel slick, but no bodies or
survivors.
</p><p>
   The plane, which can carry four people, was seen hitting the
water shortly after 11 a.m. by a fisherman, who radioed the Coast
Guard, according to Petty Officer Jeff Fenn, a spokesman for the
base at Governors Island in New York Harbor.
</p><p>
   By midafternoon, several vessels and a helicopter were combing
the area about eight miles east of Sea Bright, N.J., and seven
miles south of the Ambrose Light, the Coast Guard said. The area is
55 miles from the site off Long Island where a TWA 747 crashed one
week earlier.
</p><p>
   Searchers found the plane's landing gear, seat cushions and
other debris, Petty Officer Fenn said. He said the water is about
125 feet deep in the crash area and that much of the wreckage had
sunk.
</p><p>
   The Coast Guard said the craft had taken off from Allaire
Airport in Monmouth County, N.J. The Federal Aviation
Administration said the plane was registered to Delaware
Environmental Development Service of Wilmington. There was no
listing for the company in Wilmington.

SECURITY IN ATHENS BETTER THAN AT JFK, EXPERTS SAYS
(lh)
By PAM BELLUCK
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Immediately after the crash of TWA Flight 800 on July 17,
speculation focused on the possibility that the plane had been
sabotaged at its previous stop before New York, the airport in
Athens, Greece.
</p><p>
   The airport has had a reputation for lax security since 1985,
when terrorists hijacked TWA Flight 847 departing from Athens and
tortured and killed a U.S. Navy diver on board. In March, the
Federal Aviation Administration issued a travel warning for the
airport, but lifted it in May after a new training program for
airport police began.
</p><p>
   Airline and airport staffs based in Athens and New York, along
with aviation security experts, say that Hellenikon International
Airport in Athens has more security precautions in effect than
Kennedy International Airport. In fact, these experts say, European
airports have gone much further toward combating the threat of
explosives on airplanes than airports in the United States.
</p><p>
   ``Our focus has been anti-hijacking, as opposed to
anti-sabotage,'' said Billie Vincent, a former director of security
with the FAA and now a private airline security consultant. ``The
threat changed, but we did not change our focus.''
</p><p>
   For example, before the plane left Athens on the morning of July
17 as Flight 881 to New York, a security firm that is a subsidiary
of TWA searched for bombs, contraband or suspicious items in hidden
parts of the aircraft, like the panels that line the luggage
compartment and the crevices underneath the toilet or other
bathroom fixtures.
</p><p>
   Such a security sweep was not done when the plane landed at
Kennedy Airport or before it took off for Paris. Other airlines,
including United, Avianca and Air Jamaica, which stop along several
known drug smuggling routes, hire private security companies to
conduct such sweeps before their planes take off from Kennedy. Many
of the companies also monitor the people who clean the airplane
when it is on the ground, to make sure they do not plant drugs on
the aircraft. TWA, which does not travel to countries that are on
prominent drug routes, does not.
</p><p>
   Takis Tassopoulos, director of the Aviation Security Division in
Athens, said Greek police dog units inspect each flight leaving for
New York.
</p><p>
   Also in Athens, hand luggage is X-rayed twice, when passengers
enter the terminal and just before they get on the plane, reducing
the possibility that someone could place an explosive device in a
passenger's carry-on luggage. At Kennedy Airport, hand luggage is
X-rayed only upon entering the terminal, which is supposed to be
sealed off from anyone who is not a passenger or an employee.
</p><p>
   Air cargo is also more strictly scrutinized in Athens, said a
representative of a U.S. air carrier there who insisted on
anonymity.
</p><p>
   ``We secure all our cargo,'' said the official, who said most
American carriers in Greece have their own cargo X-ray machines.
``I can't tell you we X-ray everything. But there are systems in
place so everything is secured. Cargo is often manually searched.''

INVESTIGATORS SEE `EERIE SIMILARITIES' WITH OTHER AIRLINERS THAT
BLEW UP
(With TWA-CRASH)
(sw)
By DON VAN NATTA JR.
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  A;N;D;MD;  When an explosion ripped through a French airliner
flying over the Sahara in 1989, the blast severed the DC-10's front
end from the rest of the plane, which stayed aloft for about 20
seconds before plunging into the ground. The black boxes showed
that everything on board was normal until a jarring, split-second
noise was followed by silence.
</p><p>
   Two days later, investigators said the crash was caused by a
bomb.
</p><p>
   When Pan Am Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
December 1988, the nose of the aircraft broke away from the rest of
the plane, scattering debris over 80 square miles of Scottish
countryside. The black boxes showed everything on board was normal,
until a split-second noise, followed by silence.
</p><p>
   Within three days, investigators said the probable cause was a
bomb.
</p><p>
   In both cases, investigators based their pronouncements that the
airplanes were destroyed by bombs not on forensic evidence found in
a laboratory, but instead on early examinations of wreckage and the
circumstances of the crashes.
</p><p>
   In some ways, the circumstances surrounding the explosion of
Trans World Airlines Flight 800 on July 17 are strikingly similar
to the bombings of the other two. An explosion caused Flight 800's
front end to break away from the rest of the Boeing 747, which
continued to fly for about 20 seconds before becoming engulfed by a
fireball. Flight 800's black boxes show that everything on board
was normal until a split-second sound was followed by silence.
</p><p>
   Yet two weeks after Flight 800 exploded off the coast of Long
Island, federal officials have not determined the cause of the
crash, or even publicly declared their strong, private suspicions
that a bomb, possibly hidden in the forward cargo hold, destroyed
the aircraft. The investigators on Long Island also have something
the investigators of the other two bombings did not have: dozens of
eyewitness accounts that the plane exploded in midair.
</p><p>
   Investigators explain their caution by saying they do not want
to leap to conclusions that might later be proved wrong. Several
officials in Washington said that some White House officials
appeared eager to respond aggressively to the crash with
condemnations of terrorism. But, the officials said, Justice
Department officials did not want to exaggerate the threat of
terrorism, and were wary of offering conclusions without clear-cut
evidence.
</p><p>
   In addition, some officials said, the wariness goes beyond the
TWA flight itself. They said federal security officials,
preoccupied by terror concerns at the Olympics, have wanted to
avoid declaring the crash a terrorist act because of fears that
such a determination would provoke domestic and foreign extremists.
</p><p>
   At each daily briefing, James Kallstrom, the assistant director
of the FBI in New York, says, ``The investigation is continuing,''
and he refuses to say a bomb is the most likely cause of the
explosion. Officials said they would not declare the crash to be a
result of a bomb until they had found traces of bomb materials on
wreckage from the crash.
</p><p>
   On both the Lockerbie jet and the French airliner, a bomb was
hidden in a piece of luggage stored in the front cargo hold. The
force of the blast caused the front of both planes to split off in
midair.
</p><p>
   Because Flight 800 broke apart in a similar way, investigators
have privately speculated that the front cargo hold was the most
likely place a bomb was hidden.
</p><p>
   ``There are so many similarities, it's almost eerie,'' said one
federal official, who insisted on anonymity. ``It would be a major
surprise if this turned out to be some mechanical failure.''
</p><p>
   In the 14 days since the crash of the TWA jet, a powerful
dynamic has settled over the inquiry. Federal investigators refuse
to say publicly what they overwhelmingly agree on in private: a
powerful explosive destroyed the plane.
</p><p>
   Investigators are always reluctant to declare the official cause
of an airplane crash until there is conclusive physical evidence.
In the investigations of the downings of Union de Transports Ariens
Flight 772, the one that crashed in Africa, and Pan Am Flight 103,
investigators had the distinct advantage of recovering airplane
wreckage over land. Some pieces clearly showed characteristics
consistent with an explosive.
</p><p>
   But Flight 800 investigators have had to retrieve pieces of
potential evidence from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, 120 feet
below the surface, which has made the hunt for conclusive evidence
that much more difficult.
</p><p>
   Those same challenges faced officials more than a decade ago
when they investigated the crash of an Air-India 747, which was
bombed off the coast of Ireland in June 1985. The wreckage settled
6,700 feet below the surface of the Irish Sea, and it took more
than six months before officials declared it to be a bomb.

RECOVERY VESSELS: VARIED HISTORY AND FUNCTIONS
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By DAVID L. CHANDLER
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The Navy ships Grasp and Grapple were built to rescue or tow
ships or submarines in distress and to salvage sunken vessels, but
their work this week on the recovery of TWA Flight 800 is not the
first time they have been used to retrieve aircraft  A;N;D;MD;  or even
spacecraft.
</p><p>
   Less than two months after it was commissioned, the Grasp, the
older of the two vessels, was used in 1986 to pick up pieces of the
space shuttle Challenger from the sea floor off Florida.
</p><p>
   The Grapple, commissioned a year later, was once used to recover
two F-14 jets that had crashed in 190 feet of water, although a
Navy spokesman declined to specify where or when this operation
took place. More conventionally, it has towed decommissioned
nuclear submarines to their final ports, it has towed three
minesweepers to the Persian Gulf before the Gulf War, and it helped
with harbor cleanup in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo.
</p><p>
   The two ships working on the TWA effort off Long Island are the
most advanced salvage ships in the world, and they are outfitted
with the latest in equipment for surveying the sea floor,
supporting teams of divers and raising debris, the Navy says.
</p><p>
   For the TWA salvage, the ships' most important equipment are
Remotely Operated Vehicles, or ROVs  A;N;D;MD;  small unpiloted submersibles,
connected by cables to the ship. The submirsibles carry cameras,
sonar and laser equipment, and claws to grab and retrieve objects.
They are controlled from the ship by operators who watch television
screens displaying the ROVs' sea floor view. They are capable of
diving to 7,200 feet, although the TWA operation is in relatively
shallow water, only 100 to 120 feet deep.
</p><p>
   Much of the technology they employ is relatively new. In
particular, the advent of the Global Positioning System satellites
should make it much easier for divers to locate precisely specific
targets that have been identified with the side-scan sonar used to
map the area. The system can pinpoint a location to within a few
feet.
</p><p>
   The robotic submersibles also carry advanced scanning systems
that use a narrow beam of laser light to locate objects on the sea
floor. A small moving mirror reflects the laser beam back and forth
across the bottom, as a light receptor builds up an image of the
debris field. The image is created one line at a time as the
submirsible is towed along, much as a computer's flatbed scanner
translates an image into digital data one line at a time.
</p><p>
   This is the first time the laser scanner has been used in an
actual salvage operation, said a Navy spokesman, Lt. j.g. Joe
Walker.
</p><p>
   But even with the best of equipment, the skill of the operator
can make a big difference, said James Bellingham, director of the
underwater vehicle laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. For one thing, in the murky environment of the sea
floor, it can be very difficult to get a sense of the scale of
objects located by the sonar or laser devices.
</p><p>
   To illustrate, Bellingham cited a research project he worked on
in New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee. A submersible found an
object the researchers thought was a coffee cup. Pulled to the
surface, it was found to be a chamber pot. ``We couldn't gauge what
the size was by looking at the video,'' he said.
</p><p>
   Locating pieces of the aircraft on the ocean floor is difficult
enough; recovering them is even trickier, Bellingham said. ``It's a
tough thing to do, and very much depends on surface conditions,''
he said.
</p><p>
   There are three basic ways to recover objects: with a ``lifting
bag,'' a canvas bag that is placed around the object and filled
with air to cause it to rise to the surface; using an ROV to grasp
the object in its claws and carry it up; or attaching cables to it
and hoisting it directly to the ship.
</p><p>
   The ROV is by far the gentlest and the least likely to cause
further damage to the object, said Navy spokesman Walker.

BOHEMIA, N.Y.: agency's concern.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Yet, in the case of the TWA crash, Megadata's records proved
invaluable to federal officials.
</p><p>
   After Keller's phone call, safety board investigators and FBI
agents went to Megadata's office to view charts and determine what
other aircraft were in position to see the final moments of Flight
800.
</p><p>
   Eyewitness reports are considered by aviation experts to be
extremely unreliable, and the Megadata information helped establish
whether the other pilots were in positions to see what they claimed
to see.
</p><p>
   Based on FAA radar scans that emanated from Riverhead,
Megadata's charts indicated that two aircraft  A;N;D;MD;  an Army Black Hawk
helicopter and an Air National Guard C-130 cargo plane  A;N;D;MD;  were
indeed in position to have observed the fireball.
</p><p>
   FAA radar systems of the type used in Riverhead send out pulses
of energy that are reflected off metal objects in the sky, making
blips on a screen. The systems also send out electronic queries,
asking the identity and altitude of planes with on-board
transponders  A;N;D;MD;  special radios that can respond to the FAA queries
by emitting electronic identification codes one one-millionth of a
second later.
</p><p>
   Subtracting that microsecond and dividing by the speed of light,
the FAA knows the range, or how far away the plane is. By keeping
track of precisely where the circular-scan radar beam is pointed
when it asks the question, the FAA knows the direction, or bearing,
of the aircraft.
</p><p>
   Megadata's system simply eavesdrops. The main components are a
receive-only antenna, about 5 feet high, which can be miles from
the nearest airport, and a work station to process the data.
</p><p>
   Although the company is searching for more customers, the reason
some buyers have been willing to pay $250,000 or so for a Megadata
system can be traced to the tight FAA strictures on air-to-ground
communications.
</p><p>
   When a plane is below 10,000 feet a ``sterile cockpit'' must be
maintained with no work or conversation not directly related to
flying the plane. That includes a ban on talk by crew members to
dispatchers at their airlines.
</p><p>
   For incoming flights, the radio blackout can leave airline
ground crews in the dark about precisely whether a plane will
arrive in time to let passengers make connecting flights or whether
controllers have put the plane into a low-altitude holding pattern.
</p><p>
   And even if radio contact were permitted, when several dozen of
an airline's planes are to land within minutes of one another,
calling them all would be too time-consuming, according to Capt.
William B. Cotton, United's manager of air traffic and flight
systems.
</p><p>
   United has become Megadata's largest client, using the systems
in Chicago, Denver, San Francisco, Los Angeles and at Dulles
International near Washington.
</p><p>
   ``It's a very, very clever invention,'' Cotton said. With the
click of a mouse, he said, United's dispatchers can view all planes
aloft in the vicinity, or simply all United planes, or focus on a
single aircraft. The system gives ground crews an estimated time of
arrival that is more accurate than pilots or dispatchers have been
able to provide, Cotton said.
</p><p>
   If a plane is going to be late, United uses the system to
decide, for example, whether to hold other planes on the ground to
let passengers make their connections. If its plane is in a holding
pattern above 10,000 feet, the airline can also tell its pilot how
long the wait is likely to be to help decide whether to divert to
another airport  A;N;D;MD;  information that the FAA generally does not
provide, Cotton said.
</p><p>
   Airport managers use Megadata's information mostly to enforce
noise-abatement ordinances.
</p><p>
   ``We get complaints all the time,'' said Ron Wilson, a spokesman
for San Francisco International Airport, which has used the
Megadata system to resolve hundreds of complaints in the last few
years.
</p><p>
   ``People say: `I saw a 747 come over my house at 500 feet. I
know it was 500 feet because I could see the pilots. I could read
the numbers. I could see the wheels.' ''
</p><p>
   Using the Megadata work station, Wilson said airport officials
could enter the location and the time into the work station and
quickly determine the facts. ``We can tell them, it wasn't 500 feet
 A;N;D;MD;  it was 3,500 feet,'' he said.

INVESTIGATORS: TWA EXPLOSION DIDN'T ORIGINATE NEAR COCKPIT
(With TWA-CRASH-FAMILY)
(kd)
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   NEW YORK  A;N;D;MD;  After picking apart some of the wadded remains of the
cockpit of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, investigators concluded
Tuesday that the catastrophic explosion that destroyed the Boeing
747 most likely did not originate inside the cockpit or in the
electronics bay beneath it.
</p><p>
   They were partly persuaded by a surprising discovery found in
the ton of wreckage that had been the jet's cockpit: The circles of
glass that cover many of the cockpit dials, and even a light bulb
above a staircase that led to the plane's upper deck, had somehow
survived the crash intact.
</p><p>
   ``You have this mass of wreckage and yet things from that area
are relatively the way they were before the accident,'' said Robert
T. Francis, vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board. ``There is no indication at this point of anything in that
area that would give cause for concern in terms of something having
initiated there.''
</p><p>
   A senior investigator who looked at the cockpit wreckage Tuesday
said that one of the plane's altimeters  A;N;D;MD;  instruments that show the
plane's altitude  A;N;D;MD;  was frozen with a reading of 13,100 feet.
Altimeters are mechanically driven instruments that do not depend
on electricity to work, so the finding suggests that the mechanics
continued working for several seconds after the initial explosion,
at about 13,700 feet.
</p><p>
   Federal investigators continued their search for the cause of
the crash Tuesday, the 20th day since Flight 800 exploded in midair
off Long Island and plunged into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all
230 people on board. On the seas and on the shore, investigators
said they made a modest amount of progress, though they still have
not determined if the plane crash was caused by a bomb, a missile
attack or a mechanical malfunction.
</p><p>
   At the former Grumman hangar in Calverton, investigators on
Tuesday began piecing together the fractured parts of the airplane.
They also pulled about one-third of the cockpit wreckage off the
one-ton ball of metal, essentially unwrapping it.
</p><p>
   James K. Kallstrom, the assistant director of the FBI's New York
office, said he had sent many agents who had been working in
Suffolk County back to their home offices, mostly in New York City.
Criminal investigators are anxious for the cause to be determined,
he said, adding: ``We are in a bit of a waiting pattern.''

TWA PROBERS SEE LITTLE CHANCE OF MORE BODIES RECOVERED
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By FRED KAPLAN
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SMITHTOWN, N.Y.  A;N;D;MD;  Investigators said Wednesday that they have
given up hope of finding the remaining 35 victims from the wreckage
of TWA Flight 800.
</p><p>
   In the three weeks since the crash, divers have brought up 195
of the 230 passengers and crew who were aboard the jumbo jet on
July 17. But as Navy salvage ships continue to bring up large
pieces of wreckage from the plane, it is becoming less likely that
many more bodies remain hidden.
</p><p>
   Robert Francis, vice chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, said finding victims remains the top priority. But
``there's just not the kind of wreckage out there anymore where
we'd expect to find bodies,'' he said.
</p><p>
   He said that families have been told and that they are ``pretty
understanding.''
</p><p>
   In another development, the Federal Aviation Administration is
expected to announce Tjirdau that it will requiring testing of fuel
pumps on 747s for electrical resistance.
</p><p>
   There are 14 pumps on the jumbo jet's wings, and low resistance
indicates they could develop arcing that might lead to a fuel leak
and a possible fire. In May 1995, a fire related to a fuel pump
leak broke out in the wheelwell of a Japan Airlines plane. It was
extinguished before the plane took off.
</p><p>
   The TWA jet experienced a power loss and its cockpit-voice and
flight data recorders ended abruptly, which investigators say would
not have happened in the case of an engine failure or explosion.
</p><p>
   In the past few days, as fewer and fewer victims have been
found, investigators have shifted their attention to recovering
pieces of the plane that could be crucial to solving the mystery of
what caused the 747 to explode in midair on July 17.
</p><p>
   The salvage ship USS Grasp pulled up a 75-foot-long section of
the plane's right wing Wednesday, with a chunk of the fuselage
attached to it. Francis said he saw burn marks on the wing, but he
warned against drawing conclusions from that, noting that the
ocean's surface was on fire when the plane crashed and the wing
could have been burned when it hit the water.
</p><p>
   Technicians onboard the Grasp were working on cutting the wing
in two, so that it would fit onto the tugboat bringing pieces of
the wreckage back to the Grumman aircraft hangar on Long Island,
where they are being analyzed.
</p><p>
   Investigators are also now interested in bringing up the plane's
engines as quickily as possible. Two of the four engines  A;N;D;MD;  and a
piece of the third  A;N;D;MD;  have been found by sonar detectors.
</p><p>
   Francis said the engines are key evidence, mainly because they
might show where the explosion came from  A;N;D;MD;  a missile from outside
the plane or a bomb from within, and, if the latter, where in the
plane.
</p><p>
   He said a ``rub strip'' is inside the engine, surrounding its
fan blades. When the blades rotate, the strip keeps them from
damaging the engine's shell.
</p><p>
   ``In an accident, you can sometimes tell from the rub strip what
kind of forces have come to bear on the aircraft,'' Francis said.
``You can end up with the fan clipping part of the rub strip. An
engineer can figure out where that force came from.''
</p><p>
   James Kallstrom, the FBI assistant director involved in the
investigation, said, ``We're very pleased with the speed of the
recovery of parts of the aircraft.''
</p><p>
   When asked if it might be a few weeks or more before they figure
out what caused the explosion, he replied: ``It could very well be.
I would hope it won't be that long ... Whether it's a week or two
weeks or four days, I don't know.''

   WASHINGTON  A;N;D;MD;  A military plane carrying a Secret Service agent
and an Air Force crew of eight crashed into a mountain minutes
after taking off from President Clinton's Wyoming retreat late
Saturday night, killing everyone on board, officials said.
</p><p>
   The C-130 aircraft was carrying the Secret Service agent and an
automobile used by security officers in presidential motorcades. It
was bound from Jackson Hole, Wyo., where Clinton spent his holiday,
to New York City, where he was to attend a 50th birthday party
Sunday night.
</p><p>
   The plane took off from the Jackson Hole airport at about 10:45
p.m. Saturday night, according to state and local officials in
Wyoming and an Air Force spokesman in Texas, where the crew of the
plane was based.
</p><p>
   About three minutes later, after flying about 15 miles southeast
and reaching an altitude of about 10,000 feet, the C-130 slammed
into the side of Sheep Mountain, known locally as Sleeping Indian.
It exploded in a fireball visible in Teton Village, a resort town
20 miles away. The crash site was about 1,000 feet below the
11,300-foot summit.
</p><p>
   A party of 28 searchers set out for the remote site on foot and
on horseback a few hours later. But the impact of the explosion,
with the plane hitting the mountain above the timberline at 200
miles an hour or more with about 18 tons of fuel on board, was so
severe that they found little more than smouldering fragments.
</p><p>
   The C-130 has generally been considered an unusually safe
aircraft  A;N;D;MD;  a slow, fat, reliable workhorse, nicknamed the Hercules,
and is used mostly to haul people and equipment around the world.
But this crash was the third fatal one involving a C-130 in the
past 15 months.
</p><p>
   Four weeks ago, a C-130 flown by the Belgian Air Force crashed
in the Netherlands, killing 32 people, most of them members of a
Dutch military orchestra. And in May 1995, a C-130 carrying six Air
Force reservists went down in southern Idaho after an engine caught
fire, killing all aboard.
</p><p>
   Saturday night's crash was also the third time in the past 16
months that an Air Force plane has carried U.S. government
officials to their death.
</p><p>
   In April 1995, an Air Force C-21, a military version of a
Learjet executive aircraft, crashed in Alabama and killed Clark G.
Fiester, an assistant Air Force secretary. A year later, two Air
Force pilots trying to land their military Boeing 737 at Dubrovnik,
Croatia, flew straight into the highest peak for miles around,
killing all 35 people aboard, including Secretary of Commerce
Ronald H. Brown.
</p><p>
   A study of military aircraft mishaps published six months ago by
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
found that 73 percent of the most severe accidents in 1994 and 1995
were caused by human error, mistakes by pilots or, more rarely,
ground crews or air traffic controllers.
</p><p>
   At the White House, shortly before departing for New York,
Clinton said the deaths of the Secret Service agent and the Air
Force crew members were ``especially painful to us because they
worked for me and did an invaluable service, and I am very sad
about it.'' The president and his family had left Wyoming for
Washington a few hours before the crash on Saturday.

LOGAN AIRPORT BEEFING UP SECURITY
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By JERRY ACKERMAN
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Boston's Logan Airport expects by the end of next week to have
two explosives-detection units ready to roll out at a moment's
notice to sniff out dangerous objects in luggage and cargo
compartments, or even at check-in gates.
</p><p>
   Each weighing about 45 pounds, the units are made by Boston-area
companies, Ion Track Instruments Inc. of Wilmington and Thermedics
Inc. of Woburn. Airport security director Joseph Lawless said that
along with Logan's five trained bomb-sniffing dogs, the units will
provide another level of assurance for a flying public deeply
worried about in-flight safety.
</p><p>
   Three out of four corporate travel managers polled by the
National Business Travel Association last month, after the crash of
TWA Flight 800, said they would be willing to pay a premium on
airline tickets to improve airport security.
</p><p>
   Respondents to the poll also chided the government and airlines
for failing to take security seriously enough. Many of those who
opposed paying more said they were concerned that government would
only waste the money.
</p><p>
   Lawless said Logan is still working out whether to lease or buy
the explosives-detection devices. Ion Track's version lists for
more than $50,000, and Thermedics' for over $150,000. The two
designs also function differently, he said, but having both will
provide a testing ground for their effectiveness.
</p><p>
   Other security procedures put into force after Flight 800 went
down already are complicating the lives of passengers who book
trips ``electronically,'' without traditional tickets.
</p><p>
   Electronic ticketing eliminates paperwork and boosts airline
profit margins. Passengers get a confirmation number when they
reserve their flights. At the gate, they get a boarding pass by
repeating their number and showing a photo identification card.
</p><p>
   The system didn't work, though, when airports, including Logan,
tightened up who can get to the gates. Lawless said Logan took this
step because its higher number of overseas travelers could make the
airport more vulnerable to terrorism.
</p><p>
   Now, airlines that don't issue paper tickets must send agents to
meet their passengers at the metal detectors. With passenger lists
in hand, they check in each person individually.
--- A;N;D;QC; 
</p><p>
   JetTrain, the start-up low-fare airline that was going to fly
from Boston to Newark beginning this month, has shifted gears and
now will fly a triangular route between Boston, Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh, starting in mid-September. JetTrain has been flying
from Pittsburgh to Orlando, Fla., for the past year. Airline
spokesman Carmine Cardillo said the latest change is aimed at
filling the void left when two other low-cost carriers, ValuJet and
Nation's Air, ended Boston-Philadelphia service.
--- A;N;D;QC; 
</p><p>
   Wednesday is the launch date for Korean Air's new Boston-Seoul
service, three days a week via New York with a stop to refuel in
Anchorage. The first plane lands at Logan at 9 p.m. A ceremonial
ribbon-cutting is scheduled at the British Airways gates at 10.
Korean Air says this is the first same-plane service ever from
Boston to Asia. Massport says it's going to hold a New England
Lobster Festival in Seoul in October to promote this region as a
tourist and business destination.
--- A;N;D;QC; 
</p><p>
   About those antlers you might want to bring home as a trophy
from your hunting trip: TWA has revised its entire fee schedule for
unusual baggage since details, compiled by Best Fares magazine, ran
in this column. TWA has lifted its ban on antlers and now accepts
them at the discretion of airport agents. Also, skis, golf clubs
and fishing gear are now checked without charge versus the fees of
$45 to $75 that were previously posted. Surfboards still cost $50
extra, as do bicycles, pet kennels and scuba gear.
</p><p>
   But, according to Best Fares researcher Elaine Hewlett, cyclists
can ship their wheels free now on United Airlines  A;N;D;MD;  although United
now says it charges $50 for scuba equipment.
--- A;N;D;QC; 
</p><p>
   Two national luxury hotel chains, Fairmont and Loew's, are
offering a luxury upgrade on American Airlines flights and 1,000
frequent flier points on American if the room booking is charged to
a Visa card. You have to ask for this deal when you reserve ...
USAir has authorized its pilots to disconnect the seat-back phone
system in the event of an emergency. Pilots last week got a memo
declaring that the airline ``prefers to furnish press releases for
in-flight anomalies instead of having this information reported
live via telephone from the aircraft.'' A USAir spokesman later
said that language ``has been rescinded'' but defended the policy.

<p>
   The crash of an Air Force C-130 carrying equipment for use by
Bill Clinton is fair if gruesome warning that some day an American
president may be killed in an air crash.
</p><p>
   The Clinton family had departed Jackson Hole, Wyo., in another
plane only hours before the C-130 slammed into a mountainside
shortly after takeoff. All nine persons aboard, including a Secret
Service agent, were killed.
</p><p>
   The death of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown in April in a somewhat
similar plane crash in Croatia offered the same warning.
</p><p>
   The destruction of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island this summer,
perhaps by a bomb or even a missile, adds the chilling possibility
of terrorist assault.
</p><p>
   All these incidents, plus others  A;N;D;MD;  three fatal C-130 crashes
have occurred in 15 months  A;N;D;MD;  should suggest at least two common
sense developments.
</p><p>
    A;N;D;MD;  1) As do many husbands and wives and some top business
executives, presidents and vice presidents should follow the
practice of never flying together. Candidates for those offices
should take the same precaution, even if it hinders their ability
to campaign together.
</p><p>
    A;N;D;MD;  2) The historic custom of presidential nominees choosing their
vice presidential running mates without regard to their experience
or ability to take over the presidency, if necessary, must no
longer be accepted.
</p><p>
   Bob Dole, the recent Republican president nominee, appears to
have pondered his choice carefully and named a qualified man in
Jack Kemp, the former congressman and Cabinet member. So did
Clinton, when he chose Sen. Al Gore in 1992.
</p><p>
   As recently as 1988, however, George Bush made an apparently
quixotic choice in J. Danforth Quayle In 1952 Richard Nixon was
chosen by Republican leaders  A;N;D;MD;  not by the nominee, Dwight
Eisenhower  A;N;D;MD;  less for his presidential qualifications than for his
anti-Communist fame and acceptability to the party's ``old guard.''
</p><p>
   A constitutional amendment is not necessary to improve the
chances that a qualified vice presidential nominee will be chosen.
And, anyway, such an amendment probably would be hard to write and
impossible to enforce. What is really needed is for American voters
to turn their backs on a presidential nominee who makes a blatantly
political or otherwise unsuitable choice for vice president.
</p><p>
   Or perhaps presidential nominees should run alone and, if
elected, use provisions of the 22nd Amendment to nominate someone
for vice president.
</p><p>
   That person then would have to undergo extensive congressional
investigation and confirmation  A;N;D;MD;  as did Nelson Rockefeller, when he
was nominated for vice president by Gerald Ford in 1974. Ford had
been chosen by President Nixon when the sitting vice president,
Spiro T. Agnew, had been forced to resign.
</p><p>
   Proponents of air travel will protest, no doubt accurately, that
it is safer than any form of ground transportation. That
statistical argument overlooks the fact that an air crash is far
more likely to be fatal to all involved than are other forms of
accident.
</p><p>
   And presidents now travel almost exclusively by air  A;N;D;MD;  including
helicopters for short hauls.
</p><p>
   It will be argued, too, that no aircraft could be more carefully
maintained or skillfully operated than those used by a president.
Thousands of commercial passengers can testify to being held up in
scheduled takeoffs or landings because right-of-way was being
cleared for Air Force One.
</p><p>
   If safe air travel can be guaranteed, it certainly is for the
occupant of the White House.
</p><p>
   Still, no amount of precaution or skill can preclude the
unexpected or predict the unpredictable. And if terrorism is a
threat, as TWA 800 investigators may conclude, what juicier target
could there be than a plane carrying a president and his entourage?
</p><p>
   When I was The New York Times White House correspondent during
the Kennedy administration, a small group of us termed ourselves
``White House regulars''  A;N;D;MD;  meaning we went on every presidential
trip, no matter how insignificant or unlikely to produce news. We
did so to keep a ``death watch'' on the president  A;N;D;MD;  though none of
us really believed, until Nov. 22, 1963, that it was necessary.
</p><p>
   President Kennedy, of course, was murdered on the ground. That
does not alter the rising odds that some day or some night,
somewhere in an unaccountable world, sometime in the uncharted
future, a high-flying president will be brought to earth by chance,
or by malevolent design.

NEW YORK: the machine.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The Egis machine sniffs vapors of invisible particles. It can
detect C4, a plastic explosive made by the U.S. military, Semtex,
an explosive manufactured in Eastern Europe, and Detasheet, a
plastic compound that comes in quarter-inch thick sheets and that
contains PETN.
</p><p>
   A 10-pound vacuum sniffs a sample of air, which is then
transferred to a 4-feet-by-2-feet metal box. The machine's computer
spits out a chemical profile.
</p><p>
   Certain federal agents, calling the FBI's laboratory in
Washington a ``black hole,'' remained convinced that the bureau was
hiding its positive lab confirmations.
</p><p>
   ``There was one problem after another with this investigation,
from weather to lab results,'' a federal investigator said.
``People became incredibly frustrated. Then, with information
sacred and everybody wishing for the smoking gun, people got
paranoid. It was like separate cells were formed. Certain people
would only speak with certain other people.''
</p><p>
   While secrets were preserved, there were relaxations of the
wariness. For instance, two federal agents, after staring at a
fragment of aircraft, asked a safety board expert nearby for help.
He, in turn, had to consult with a Boeing engineer. In a moment,
the manufacturer's representative identified the part.
</p><p>
   But some investigators began to suspect that with millions of
dollars at stake, industry representatives were reading into the
wreckage what they wanted to see.
</p><p>
   One industry expert was sure he had seen ``shock waves'' in the
fuselage, a clear indication of a bomb. Law enforcement authorities
said it was unclear what the damage was, and what meaning it held.
</p><p>
   And according to a federal official, the people representing the
engine's manufacturer, Pratt A;N;D;AMP; Whitney, did not hide their relief
when the four engines had been brought to shore, opened and
declared a non-factor.
</p><p>
   ``There are camps, divided camps,'' one investigator said.
</p><p>
   The competing conclusions only fueled the news coverage of the
investigation, and thus the public's sense of what was true, what
was coming.
</p><p>
   ``The most frustrating thing is all the people that are talking
to the news media, giving different versions and having different
agendas,'' Kallstrom said. Later, he added, ``I have a problem with
anyone rooting for anything. And if they are rooting for anything
that's unique to their sphere of influence or their domain, they're
part of the problem, not part of the solution.''
</p><p>
   There was no solution to the disabling sadness. Investigators,
wearing surgical masks against the odors, created cardboard boxes
for each victim. Into each went every piece of personal belonging
that could be linked to an individual  A;N;D;MD;  wedding rings, wallets, a
coloring book.
</p><p>
   Then there were the personal belongings and the clothing that
did not have obvious owners  A;N;D;MD;  ``orphaned'' bits, the agents called
them.
</p><p>
   ``You just have to find a way to keep sorting through it all,''
said an investigator who had worked on a handful of airline bombing
investigations.
</p><p>
   ``Pick through the debris, run your eyes and hands over what
appears interesting, test it, test it again. You wait for that
jewel. Of course, it's a sick jewel, in a way.''
</p><p>
   THE PROCESS: An Epic Exercise Of Elimination
</p><p>
   Despite the initial chaos and the ensuing divisions of opinion
and operational style, a unifying thread came to course through the
investigation. The thread was frustration.
</p><p>
   The investigation, after all, had become one large, detailed map
of dead ends. Results from the forensics lab were inconclusive.
Theories of structural malfunction, from probability's outer
fringes, were undone by hard data. The ocean stubbornly refused to
give up solid leads.
</p><p>
   The entire investigation, then, became an epic exercise in
elimination. Knocking down theories  A;N;D;MD;  in their entirety or in their
speculative detail  A;N;D;MD;  became the most satisfying work.
</p><p>
   The momentum for erasing a mechanical failure as the cause of
the crash gathered early and never really relented.
</p><p>
   The aircraft had recently been through some of the most rigorous
examinations the industry requires. The black boxes revealed only
sudden silence after a split-second sound spoke volumes to
investigators, downgrading malfunction's standing as a theory.
</p><p>
   Within days of their discovery, a second major site of debris,
the front of the plane, was located. The inference was inescapable:
The plane had split  A;N;D;MD;  just as Pan Am 103 had over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
</p><p>
   A third debris field sprinkled with luggage and tiny scraps of
metal underscored the suspicion for everyone that the malfunction
theory was fantasy.
</p><p>
   The engines proved fine four weeks into the inquiry; the fuel
tank, the last, best hope for theorists of mechanical failure, did
not appear to have exploded as the initiating incident.
</p><p>
   The safety investigators privately conceded they had no known
way of explaining through mechanical failure what had occurred.
Even the mantra of their methodology  A;N;D;MD;  the history of aviation
accidents is a history of things that never happened before  A;N;D;MD;  was
recited without enthusiasm.
</p><p>
   The belief that a bomb destroyed the airplane was always
strongest. But even it suffered under the waves of negation: The
cockpit, briefly thought to be the location of the explosion, was
found mangled, but with parts of it, such as glass instrument
dials, tellingly intact. It was thus ruled out as the site of the
blast.
</p><p>
   Four weeks into the investigation, the front cargo bins, the
location of choice for numerous previous bombers, came up empty of
evidence. The bomb experts, not budging from their instinctive
conclusion that a bomb had done the damage, said, in the words of
one agent, ``No one could have imagined that 60 percent of the
plane would be up and at least some absolute proof of a bomb not
have been found.''
</p><p>
   The longshot theories, then, survived.
</p><p>
   Kallstrom, the central processor of all theories (including the
absurd E-mail tips of extra-terrestrials), had a particular
fascination with the idea that a missile had struck the aircraft.
</p><p>
   ``I gave up being surprised at anything a long time ago,''
Kallstrom said early on.

<p>
   NEW YORK  A;N;D;MD;  In June, a few weeks before the crash of Trans World
Airlines Flight 800 off Long Island, leaders of several Middle
Eastern terrorist organizations backed by the Iranian government
met in Teheran, Iran, to plan terrorist acts, intelligence
officials said Friday.
</p><p>
   Among them was the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, an organization that has been linked to
airplane bombings in the past, according to the officials. And its
leader, Ahmed Jabril, came to the meeting to ask for permission to
carry out terrorist attacks against American interests, one
intelligence official said.
</p><p>
   The organizations that attended the meeting, and the session
itself, are among a number of avenues that federal investigators
are following in their inquiry into the crash of the TWA jet,
according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</p><p>
   Although the FBI has not declared that the plane crashed as the
result of a criminal act, the FBI crime lab has found traces of
PETN, a component of plastic explosives, on a piece of wreckage
from the cabin of the plane. Investigators noted that PETN was a
component of bombs used in past terrorist bombings of airplanes.
</p><p>
   The intelligence officials cautioned that they had no evidence
linking the June meeting in Teheran to the crash on July 17. They
note that Iran is not known to have targeted Americans in recent
years and that the time span between the meeting and the crash may
have been too short to execute a complex operation.
</p><p>
   But a senior federal investigator working on the TWA case said
investigators were interested in learning more about the meeting.
At the same time, though, investigators say they are examining many
other individuals and organizations in their inquiry.
</p><p>
   If Flight 800 is proved to have been brought down by a bomb, as
most investigators strongly believe, it remains possible that no
foreign terrorists were involved. The crash could have been the
result of a domestic criminal act. Still, if the TWA crash is
eventually blamed on a terrorist attack, the investigators said
Jabril and the others who were in Teheran would be high on a short
list of suspects.
</p><p>
   Other terrorist groups identified as present at the Teheran
meeting included leaders of the Lebanese-based Hezbollah, which has
been linked to the 1983 bomb blast in Beirut that killed 241 U.S.
Marines, and the Egyptian branch of Islamic Jihad, which is loyal
to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman. He was convicted of plotting to blow up
the United Nations, and his followers were convicted of the bomb
attack on the World Trade Center.
</p><p>
   In recent years, a small number of terrorist organizations have
demonstrated the capability of bombing an airplane. While
investigators have not ruled out the possibility of a previously
unknown group, investigators say evidence amassed about the bombs
and methods used in previous attacks may yield important clues in
the investigation of Flight 800.
</p><p>
   ``If it was a bomb, determining the kind of bomb and the way it
got on the plane will narrow down the universe of suspects,'' said
Vincent Cannistraro, a private security consultant and former chief
of counterterrorism at the Central Intelligence Agency.

<p>
   To some experts in terrorism and airline security, the notion
that a missile had blown the aircraft out of the sky was
far-fetched, and several expressed amazement at the ``shelf life of
the missile theory.'' The plane was out of range, they said.
</p><p>
   But others, Kallstrom included, had a resilient fealty to the
rocket theory. He and others could not ignore the dozens of
eyewitness accounts testifying to a streaking light intersecting
with the aircraft. The details matched in many ways.
</p><p>
   In addition, the notion that Stinger missiles from Afghanistan
might have made their way into the United States was a longstanding
assumption within law enforcement circles.
</p><p>
   The presence on the crash scene of officials with the National
Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency reinforced in
some minds that there might have been some intercepted intelligence
regarding a missile attack.
</p><p>
   And so the viability of the missile theory  A;N;D;MD;  which seemed to
carry a dread greater than a bomb  A;N;D;MD;  rose and sank daily, in the
minds of Kallstrom and other investigators. Yet, Kallstrom, early
on, refused to acknowledge publicly how seriously investigators had
taken the possibility of a missile attack.
</p><p>
   ``I don't want to scare people,'' he said in front of his
agents.
</p><p>
   Investigators ran down reports of stolen boats on Long Island,
and senior investigators three days into the investigation broke
down the likelihood of the three causes this way: 45 percent
missile, 45 percent bomb, 10 percent malfunction.
</p><p>
   Kallstrom ordered his agents to research the Mistral, a
French-made missile that could be launched from a tripod and that
would have had the range capability. Other experts offered the
possibility that a small-engine Cessna might have been equipped to
fire a Sidewinder missile.
</p><p>
   The missile theory did not go away. Agents spent chunks of their
days rereading the eyewitness interviews. A kind of missile cult
emerged within the ranks of the agents. The group was never more
enthusiastic than when one of the first preliminary positive
results registered at the hangar in Calverton showed evidence of
PETN, a component found in some missiles.
</p><p>
   Meanwhile, the Department of Defense, asked to provide
investigators with a full accounting of military activity that
might have been going on in the area of the crash, launched such a
diligent inquiry that it took days to come up with complete
information, according to Kallstrom and Pentagon officials.
</p><p>
   Public records showed that the Navy had issued a warning to
mariners that it might be conducting ``firing tests'' in a section
of the sea roughly 80 nautical miles northeast of the crash scene.
The Navy also had an aircraft near the crash site. It briefly
helped recover information.
</p><p>
   By late July, Kallstrom had doubts about the missile theory, but
he never completely let go. And despite the Pentagon's assurances,
he refused to rule out a ``friendly fire'' mishap, saying only that
``it's not in the crosshairs of my radar.''
</p><p>
   Then, two weeks ago, came the most dramatic moment, which took
place in a cramped third-floor laboratory in the J. Edgar Hoover
Building in Washington. The endless frustration was snapped. The
string of inconclusive results had ended: A positive finding for
the explosives was confirmed with the most sophisticated detection
machinery in the world.
</p><p>
   The revelation of the finding  A;N;D;MD;  which investigators insist does
not rule out a missile  A;N;D;MD;  sharpened the details of the remaining
hunt: find the blast site, and with it the metal wreckage that
could be brought before the cameras.
</p><p>
   Study the ``sick jewel'' for its signatures that could produce
suspects: what contained the bomb, the exact type of explosive
used, any available fragment of the detonating device. Microscopic
clues had produced breakthroughs for investigators in the Pan Am
103 bombing, a tiny sliver of a Toshiba stereo sending agents to
North Africa.
</p><p>
   ``It doesn't get us all the way where we need to be,'' a senior
investigator said of the lab finding.
</p><p>
   But if the mystery had not been completely solved, Francis and
others believed something strongly. A wonder had been worked.
</p><p>
   Yes, it might take a full dredging of the ocean floor before the
right hunk of plane was recovered. Yes, things could have gone more
smoothly. Yes, the safety board investigators would spend the
coming months examining everything and one day recommending a range
of thoughts on industry policies on aircraft construction, perhaps
even on how the safety board and the FBI might conduct a similar,
subsequent investigation.
</p><p>
   ``What an incredible feat is being accomplished,'' Francis said
of the entire effort. ``People say Jacques Cousteau does this all
the time, Jacques Cousteau makes it look easy. Well, he's working
off Bimini where you can see 94 miles through the water, and he's
picking up shellfish, not jagged pieces of aluminum.''
</p><p>
   ``There is no McDonald's of air safety investigation,'' he said.

HIJACKED SUDANESE AIRLINER LANDS IN BRITAIN
By LOUIS J. SALOME
c.1996 Cox News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   STANSTED, England  A;N;D;MD;  Police negotiated today with several
hijackers believed to be Iraqis who seized a Sudan Airways plane
with 199 people aboard and demanded that it be flown to Britain.
</p><p>
   After nearly five hours of negotiations, 160 passengers, most of
them women and children, were allowed to leave the plane. But the
other 26 passengers along with 13 crew remained on board along with
``six or seven'' hijackers claiming to be carrying grenades and
explosives, police said.
</p><p>
   Police said the hijackers were accompanied by their families and
had asked to see a member of the Iraqi Community Association in
London, an organization that helps Iraqis seeking aslyum.
</p><p>
   Essex County police said the passengers were mostly Sudanese,
but included Syrians, Saudis, Jordanians and Palestinians. None of
the released passengers were mistreated, although three were sick
and had been taken to a hospital, police said. Their illnesses were
unrelated to the ordeal.
</p><p>
   Police were questioning the released hostages at a nearby
terminal as negotations with the hijackers, conducted by radio,
continued.
</p><p>
   ``Everyone seems calm and collected. My understanding is that no
one has been hurt,'' said Essex police spokeswoman Kim White said.
</p><p>
   Sudan Airways Flight 150 was hijacked Monday evening about 25
minutes after it left the Sudanese capital of Khartoum heading for
Amman, Jordan.
</p><p>
   The Airbus 310 jetliner landed at Larnaca International Airport
in Cyprus to refuel before being forced on to London. Cyprus
aviation officials quoted one hijacker as saying he wanted
political asylum in Britain.
</p><p>
   The plane arrived at Stansted, London's third airport 30 miles
to the northeast, at 4:30 a.m. today (11:30 p.m., Eastern time,
Monday). Armed and masked Essex police officers surrounded the
aircraft as it stood in an isolated spot on the tarmac two miles
from the terminal.
</p><p>
   In hijack situations, British authorities usually direct planes
to Stansted, which is especially prepared for such events and is
located in a rural area, rather than to the busier Heathrow or
Gatwick airports.
</p><p>
   It has been 14 years since a hijacked airplane has landed in
Britain.
</p><p>
   About a dozen police, fire and rescue vehicles were arrayed far
from the plane in case of an accident or if the negotiations turned
sour.
</p><p>
   Police said the hijackers were releasing the passengers in
groups of 10 or so at a time and that they hoped more would be
freed.
</p><p>
   It was the second hijacking this year involving a Sudanese
airliner.
</p><p>
   On March 24, a Sudan Airways Airbus A320 plane carrying 40
passengers and crew on an internal flight was hijacked to Asmara,
the Eritrean capital, where the two Sudanese hijackers surrendered
and sought political asylum.

   OSLO, Norway  A;N;D;MD;  A Russian jetliner carrying more than 140 people
 A;N;D;MD;  mostly coal miners and their families  A;N;D;MD;  crashed into a mountain
Thursday on the remote Arctic island of Spitsbergen in Norwegian
territory. There appeared to be no survivors, Norwegian authorities
said.
</p><p>
   The three-engine Tupolev Tu-154 owned by Vnukovo Airlines was
nearing the end of a flight from Moscow when it went off course
amid low clouds and struck Opera Mountain, a 3,000-foot peak six
miles east of Svalbard Airport at Longyearbyen, the island's main
settlement.
</p><p>
   The passengers were described as Russians and Ukrainians, most
of them workers for the Trust Arktik Ugol mining company. They were
a relief force for an equal number of miners and family members who
had been waiting at the airport to take the same jet back to
Moscow.
</p><p>
   Russia's ambassador to Norway, Yuri Fokine, said that up to 20
children were aboard the jet, but Norwegian authorities in touch
with the airline maintained that the passenger list comprised 125
adults and 4 children, in addition to either 12 or 14 crew members.
</p><p>
   Flight controllers reported losing radio contact with the jet at
10:15 a.m. At 12:06 p.m. a Norwegian search party in two
helicopters and a light plane found most of the wreckage on a snowy
plateau, officials said. The rear section of the jet had tumbled
down a cliff, causing a small avalanche.
</p><p>
   Five rescue workers who landed at the scene determined that
there were no survivors, then left three and a half hours later
because of thickening fog, Norway's Rescue Coordination Center
said. It said the temperature was in the high 30s.
</p><p>
   Fokine praised the rescue effort in an interview with Norwegian
television and added, ``There was no sign of life when the
helicopters arrived.''
</p><p>
   A Norwegian minister, Jan Hoifoedt, informed the group waiting
at the airport of the crash.
</p><p>
   ``The tears flowed,'' Hoifoedt told a radio interviewer. ``Many
had friends, work acquaintances and even some family members
aboard. It is a huge tragedy for so small a community.''
</p><p>
   Spitsbergen is the largest island in the Svalbard archipelago,
about 350 miles north of the Norwegian mainland. A 1920 treaty gave
Norway ownership of the archipelago, but the Soviet Union acquired
mining rights in 1935.
</p><p>
   Of Svalbard's population of 2,500, almost two-thirds are
citizens of former Soviet republics. They operate two mines  A;N;D;MD;  in
Pyramiden and Barentsburg  A;N;D;MD;  extracting some 600,000 tons of coal a
year, about twice the output of Norwegian mines.
</p><p>
   Investigators from Oslo and Moscow are not expected to reach the
crash site until Friday morning, when removal of the bodies is to
begin. The Norwegian government was also sending criminal
investigators, though officials said there was no immediate sign of
foul play.
</p><p>
   Early this evening a Norwegian helicopter crew managed to lift
two prefabricated cabins onto the plateau near the wreckage. From
there, two or three sentries were to make sure the site is not
disturbed during the night.
</p><p>
   ``There are about 2,000 polar bears on this island,'' said Rune
B. Hansen, the acting governor. ``We haven't seen any around here
lately but they are unpredictable and can suddenly be anywhere.''
</p><p>
   Though the number of air fatalities in the former Soviet Union
has declined in the last two years, it remains alarmingly high
compared to what it was during the Soviet era.
</p><p>
   When the Soviet airline Aeroflot was broken up five years ago,
many new air companies were created. Vnukovo Airlines is one of
dozens of these so-called ``babyflots,'' which have been plagued by
lack of cash and poor maintenance. Many if not most of the aircraft
in the Russian fleets are long past retirement age.
</p><p>
   An official at Vnukova Airlines in Moscow refused to comment
Thursday night on the crash.

VALUJET GETS PERMISSION TO FLY AGAIN
(bl)
By ADAM BRYANT
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that Valujet
Airlines, grounded for more than two months after a deadly crash in
the Everglades, could start flying again under greater agency
scrutiny.
</p><p>
   The approval, one of two hurdles the airlines must clear before
resuming service, comes 10 weeks after the agency ordered a halt to
its operations because of systemic safety problems uncovered after
the crash on May 11 of a Valujet DC-9 that killed all 110 people
aboard.
</p><p>
   Valujet also received tentative approval Thursday to resume
flights from the Department of Transportation, which evaluates the
competence and safety record of an airline's managers as well as
the carrier's economic health.
</p><p>
   With the department's decision, a seven-day comment period
begins during which the agency will receive any objections to
letting Valujet resume service.
</p><p>
   It will review the objections, give Valujet a chance to respond
and then make its final determination. If Valujet clears this
second hurdle with no objections, it could be back in the air as
soon as next Thursday.
</p><p>
   Transportation officials, however, are likely to hear again
about Valujet from the Association of Flight Attendants, a union
representing flight attendants at the airline.
</p><p>
   The union has repeatedly complained to the transportation
department in recent weeks that Valujet's senior officers are not
fit to run a safe airline in large measure because of the lapses
found at Valujet.
</p><p>
   The department said Thursday that it had taken into account the
union's recent objections in making its tentative decision. A
lawyer representing the union, Robert S. Clayman, said Thursday
that the union planned to file more complaints.
</p><p>
   ``What the DOT has suggested today is that the men in charge of
the airline were in no way responsible for all of the safety
violations that caused their shutdown,'' Mr. Clayman said in an
interview. ``We thought it was one strike and you're out, not trial
and error.''
</p><p>
   John V. Coleman, director of aviation analysis at the
department, said in a conference call with reporters that the two
top officers of Valujet  A;N;D;MD;  Robert Priddy, chairman, and Lewis H.
Jordan, president  A;N;D;MD;  had good safety records over their long airline
careers. ``Nothing in their background suggests that they have been
noncompliant with federal regulations of any kind,'' he said.
</p><p>
   The aviation agency said Thursday that Valujet had been approved
to resume service with nine aircraft, and could quickly add up to
six more. Valujet had 51 aircraft in its fleet when the airline was
shut down June 17. The safety lapses that led to Valujet's
grounding were not directly linked to the cause of the crash.
</p><p>
   Since the grounding of Valujet, the airline had met the agency's
requirements for resuming service, including revising its
maintenance program and procedures, revising its organizational
structure and adding new maintenance and management personnel, and
retraining pilots and maintenance workers, the FAA said Thursday.
The airline also will initially fly only one type of DC-9.
</p><p>
   The FAA also said it would raise the number of inspectors
assigned to Valujet to seven from three, and closely scrutinize its
plans to expand once it resumes flying.
</p><p>
   Valujet executives said Thursday that they hoped to resume
service to Atlanta and four as yet unnamed cities in about two
weeks.
</p><p>
   The FAA appears to have changed its approach to speaking
publicly about the safety of Valujet. Immediately after the May 11
crash, top FAA and DOT officials declared Valujet a safe airline.
</p><p>
   When asked Thursday whether the FAA now considered Valujet safe,
Bill White, deputy director of flight standards at the FAA,
responded only by saying that Valujet was in compliance with safety
regulations.
</p><p>
   ``It's up to Valujet to maintain the safe operation of the
aircraft,'' he said.

OVERSIGHT FAULTED IN POLICE HELICOPTER CRASH REPORT
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BOSTON  A;N;D;MD;  A;N;D;UR;  A;N;D;LR; Top State Police officials were warned of management
problems within the air wing even before the February 1995
helicopter crash that killed two troopers and two civilians,
according to a report issued Friday.
</p><p>
   The final administrative report of the State Police on the crash
repeats the October 1995 findings of the National Transportation
Safety Board on the two contributing causes of the crash  A;N;D;MD;  State
Police management's failure to provide adequate oversight of the
air wing, and fuel contamination from an poorly maintained facility
in Framingham.
</p><p>
   But the report adds explicitly that a third cause of the
aircraft's crash into a Memorial Drive boathouse in Cambridge was
``failure of the pilot to execute a proper autorotation,'' a safety
procedure designed to allow an emergency landing after engine
failure.
</p><p>
   The crash of the American Eurocopter ASTAR craft killed two
state police troopers and pilots, James Mattaliano and Paul Perry,
and two civilian employees of ATA;N;D;AMP;T who were also aboard, Arthur
Howell and Michael McCarthy.
</p><p>
   Friday's report chronicled two instances in which warnings were
sent to State Police management pointing to problems in its
aviation wing.
</p><p>
   In one case, a civilian manager at Norwood Airport reported
observing ``a lack of training activity'' among the police unit and
reported complaints about ``training practices and
professionalism'' within the air wing.
</p><p>
   That manager, who is unnamed but is employed by a company that
is a defendant in a lawsuit resulting from the accident, met with
top State Police officials in 1993 to express his concerns.
</p><p>
   Although he recalls telling the officials, including Secretary
of Public Safety Kathleen O'Toole that ``pilots no longer seemed to
practice autorotations when returning from a mission as had been
past practice,'' neither O'Toole nor two state police majors who
attended the meeting recalled that specific warning.
</p><p>
   In addition to that manager's warning, in March 1994 Sgt.
Richard Welby, an air-wing pilot, wrote a report containing his
belief that officers were not being adequately trained in emergency
procedures. All pilots later received training, though a
recommendation for advanced training had been denied because of a
lack of funding.
</p><p>
   The report issued Friday said Welby's concerns were communicated
to Col. Charles Henderson, but Henderson ``does not recall
receiving the document.'' Henderson has since retired as head of
the State Police after being pressured to leave, in part because of
the fatal crash.
</p><p>
   One State Police lieutenant said that, although the wing met
technical training requirements, ``he did not feel that formal
training was up to the standards one would expect.''
</p><p>
   O'Toole issued a statement Friday, saying, ``My thoughts and
prayers go out to the families of the crash victims as they once
again relive the tragedy that befell us all. Although nothing can
be done to return those lost I am pleased with the comprehensive
nature of this report.''
</p><p>
   The report reviews significant changes that have been made since
the crash, and others that are planned.
</p><p>
   So far, aviation consultants have been hired to reorganize the
air wing, the Department of State Police is seeking additional
money to replace aircraft and ground facilities, more training has
been required of air-wing managers, and the Framingham fuel
facility has been permanently closed.
</p><p>
   The report ruled out any acts of sabotage, but it said that
among police management there was ``organizational confusion
resulting from a lack of designated responsibility'' for taking
care of the fuel facility.
</p><p>
   Water contamination in the fuel found in the system of the
wrecked helicopter ranged from 2.5 to nine times the allowable
limit.
</p><p>
   ``We have learned from this tragedy,'' says the report, signed
by Reed V. Hillman, State Police superintendent.

ROUGH SEAS PARALYZE SEARCH FOR PLANE WRECKAGE
(sw)
By ANDREW C. REVKIN
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SMITHTOWN, N.Y.  A;N;D;MD;  On the 50th day after the crash of Trans World
Airlines Flight 800, senior investigators said that persistent
rough seas off the coast of Long Island had paralyzed efforts to
collect the remaining wreckage of the shattered jumbo jet.
</p><p>
   The only activity by divers in the past seven days was one
six-hour mission completed early on Thursday morning, Robert
Francis, the vice chairman of the National Transportation Safety
Board, said. The divers, from the Navy ship Grapple, were able to
reach the last remaining large field of debris, but rising seas on
the surface and storm-stirred silt on the bottom reduced visibility
to almost zero and limited them to one haul of only a dozen small
pieces of wreckage, Francis said.
</p><p>
   Even those pieces remained on the stern of the ship as seas grew
rougher on Thursday, leaving investigators ashore with no new flow
of potential clues to the cause of the explosion that split the jet
on July 17, killing all 230 people aboard.
</p><p>
   With one hurricane recently departed and another one stirring
the Atlantic anew, conditions were so bad on Thursday morning,
Francis said, that a wave knocked him into the water as it swept
the Navy speedboat carrying him and several other investigators to
the Grapple.
</p><p>
   ``Fortunately, the admiral was kind enough to come back and get
me,'' Francis said of Rear Adm. Edward Kristensen, the pilot of the
speedboat and the Navy officer in charge of the salvage effort.
</p><p>
   Even though more than two-thirds of the aircraft had been
recovered as of a week ago, and much of that debris has been
closely scrutinized, criminal and transportation investigators say
they still lack sufficient evidence to show that the explosion was
caused by a bomb or missile rather than a mechanical failure.
</p><p>
   In a new sign that investigators still lacked many of the pieces
shed by the airplane in the earliest moments of its disintegration,
Francis said that as soon as weather permitted a sonar sweep of the
bottom would be extended west and south of the areas that had
already been searched.
</p><p>
   The decision to backtrack another half mile along the ill-fated
plane's path from Kennedy International Airport was made after a
new analysis of the last radar traces of pieces falling from the
airplane, Kristensen said.
</p><p>
   Despite the lack of new wreckage pulled from the ocean, Francis
said, investigative teams at a complex of hangars in Calverton,
were still busy working with what they already had. He said new
pieces were added on Thursday to a growing reconstruction of the
cabin between the wings.
</p><p>
   But some of the most coveted pieces of wreckage were still
missing, he said, including many parts of the center fuel tank,
which sat under a group of seats that many investigators say were
the likely center of the explosion.
</p><p>
   On Thursday, Francis confirmed previous reports that two seats
at the right end of row 23 had large holes ripped in their metal
backs. ``They may turn out to be significant,'' he said, but he
cautioned that ``there are a lot of ways things can get holes in
them after an airplane accident.''
