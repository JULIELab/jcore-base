JTBD is a ML-based sentence splitter. It can be retrained on supported
training material and is thus neither language nor domain dependent.



Dependencies

JTBD is based on a slightly modified version of the machine learning toolkit MALLET (Version 2.0.x). The
necessary libraries are included in the executable JAR (see below) and accessible via the JULIE Nexus artifact manager.


Usage

To run JTBD just run the self-executing jar "jtbd-&lt;version&gt;.jar". This will show the available modes.
