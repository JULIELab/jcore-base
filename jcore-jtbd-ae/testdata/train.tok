The first step or ' priming ' phase is a 7 day culture of T-cell depleted mononuclear cells in medium supplemented with GM-CSF and IL-4 .
The second step or ' differentiation ' phase requires the exposure to monocyte conditioned medium .
The yields of DCs from HIV + individuals were comparable to normal blood donors , 0.4 - 3 x 10(6) mature dendritic cells from 50 ml of blood .
Strong APC function was evident for both the proliferation of allogeneic T-cells in the MLR , and the generation by syngeneic T-cells of class I restricted , CTL responses to influenza virus .
A panel of dendritic cell restricted markers are expressed , including CD83 , p55 , and perinuclear CD68 .
By semi - quantitative PCR analysis , the cytokine derived cells did not express HIV-1 DNA .
We suggest that these blood derived dendritic cells will be effective for studies of immune responses to HIV-1 antigens and may be considered as adjuvants for active immunotherapy .
Intrathymic deletion of MHC class I - restricted cytotoxic T cell precursors by constitutive cross - presentation of exogenous antigen .
Cross - priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by professional antigen - presenting cells ( APC ) is a potential hazard to self tolerance because it exposes naive T cells to tissue - specific self antigens in the context of co - stimulatory signals .
Here we show that cross - presentation of exogenous material occurs constitutively within the thymus .
Although efficient cross - presentation is a property of relatively few APC it results in thymocyte deletion both in vitro and in vivo , suggesting that intrathymic cross - presentation can operate as an effective component of tolerance to circulating self antigens .
The capacity of minor cell populations to mediate thymocyte deletion but not positive selection reflects an underlying difference in the biology of these two processes .
Presence of circulating abnormal CD34 + progenitors in adult Langerhans cell histiocytosis .
Langerhans cell histiocytosis ( LCH ) is related to the proliferation of cells , which are similar to Langerhans cells ( LC ) but possess many abnormal characteristics .
Lesions are widespread and this fact suggests that LCH cells or their precursors are present in the blood of patients .
In five adult patients , we have isolated and cultured CD34 + blood progenitors of dendritic cells .
We studied their phenotype by flow cytometry and their functional properties in mixed culture with heterologous lymphocytes and with autologous lymphocytes in the presence of tri-nitro-phenyl antigen ( TNP ) .
The amount of CD34 + precursors was dramatically higher than controls but a high mortality occurred during the in vitro differentiation .
The phenotype of surviving cells was similar to LC phenotype ( CD1a + , CD83 + , Lag + ) but some of them expressed CD2 .
These cells were able to induce T cell proliferation in mixed culture .
They could not initiate primary response to TNP , except in a patient treated with thalidomide .
In our hands , these CD34 + cells may be precursors of LCH cells .
Heat shock protein 70 induced during tumor cell killing induces Th1 cytokines and targets immature dendritic cell precursors to enhance antigen uptake .
Previously , we reported that killing tumor cells in vivo with the HSV thymidine kinase / ganciclovir system generates potent antitumor immunity , determined in part by the mechanism by which the cells die and by the levels of inducible heat shock protein ( hsp ) expression induced during the process of cell death .
Here , we show that induction of hsp70 expression induces an infiltrate of T cells , macrophages , and predominantly dendritic cells ( DCs ) into the tumors as well as an intratumoral profile of Th1 cytokine expression ( IFN-gamma , TNF-alpha , and IL-12 ) and enhances immunogenicity via a T cell - mediated mechanism .
In addition , the protection conferred by hsp70 is both tumor and cell specific .
We also demonstrate that hsp70 targets immature APC to make them significantly more able to capture Ags .
This is likely to optimize cross - priming of the infiltrating APC with tumor Ags , which are simultaneously being released by the dying cells .
In addition , using an Myc epitope - tagged hsp70 expression vector , we present evidence that hsp70 released from dying tumor cells is taken up directly into DCs and may , therefore , be involved in direct chaperoning of Ags into DCs .
Taken together , our data suggest that hsp70 induction serves to signal the immune system of the presence of an immunologically relevant ( dangerous ) situation against which an immune reaction should be raised .
APCs express DCIR , a novel C-type lectin surface receptor containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine - based inhibitory motif .
We have identified a novel member of the calcium - dependent ( C-type ) lectin family .
This molecule , designated DCIR ( for dendritic cell ( DC ) immunoreceptor ) , is a type II membrane glycoprotein of 237 aa with a single carbohydrate recognition domain ( CRD ) , closest in homology to those of the macrophage lectin and hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptors .
The intracellular domain of DCIR contains a consensus immunoreceptor tyrosine - based inhibitory motif .
A mouse cDNA , encoding a homologous protein has been identified .
Northern blot analysis showed DCIR mRNA to be predominantly transcribed in hematopoietic tissues .
