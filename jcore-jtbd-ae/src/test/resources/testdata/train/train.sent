Stable and functional lymphoid reconstitution of common cytokine receptor gamma chain deficient mice by retroviral-mediated gene transfer.
Mutations in the gene encoding the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gamma(c)) are responsible for human X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCIDX1).
We have used a gamma(c)-deficient mouse model to test the feasibility and potential toxicity of gamma(c) gene transfer as a therapy for SCIDX1.
A retrovirus harboring the murine gamma(c) chain was introduced into gamma(c)-deficient bone marrow cells, which were then transplanted into alymphoid RAG2/gamma(c) double-deficient recipient mice.
Circulating lymphocytes appeared 4 weeks postgraft and achieved steady-state levels by 8 weeks.
The mature lymphocytes present in the grafted mice had integrated the gamma(c) transgene, expressed gamma(c) transcripts, and were able to proliferate in response to gamma(c)-dependent cytokines.
The gamma(c)-transduced animals demonstrated (1) normal levels of immunoglobulin subclasses, including immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG2a (which are severely decreased in gamma(c)(-) mice); (2) the ability to mount an antigen-specific, T-dependent antibody response showing effective in vivo T-B cell cooperation, and (3) the presence of gut-associated cryptopatches and intraepithelial lymphocytes.
Importantly, peripheral B and T cells were still present 47 weeks after a primary graft, and animals receiving a secondary graft of gamma(c)-transduced bone marrow cells demonstrated peripheral lymphoid reconstitution.
That gamma(c) gene transfer to hematopoietic precursor cells can correct the immune system abnormalities in gamma(c)(-) mice supports the feasibility of in vivo retroviral gene transfer as a treatment for human SCIDX1.
Essential requirement for c-kit and common gamma chain in thymocyte development cannot be overruled by enforced expression of Bcl-2.
The thymus in mice lacking both the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit and the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gamma(c)) is alymphoid because these receptors provide essential signals at the earliest stages of thymocyte development.
The signals transduced by these receptors potentially regulate proliferation, survival, or differentiation, but the contribution of each receptor to distinct intracellular signaling cascades is only poorly defined.
Here, we have examined whether enforced expression of Bcl-2 can rescue thymocyte development in c-kit and gamma(c) single or double mutant mice.
A bcl-2 transgene (E(mu)-bcl-2-25; expressed in the T cell lineage) was introduced into (a) c-kit and gamma(c) wild-type (c-kit+gamma(c)+bcl+), (b) c-kit-deficient (c-kit(-)gamma(c)+bcl+), (c) gamma(c)-deficient (c-kit+gamma(c)-bcl+), or (d) c-kit and gamma(c) double-deficient mice (c-kit-gamma(c)-bcl+).
The bcl-2 transgene was functionally active in wild-type and c-kit or gamma(c) single mutants, as it promoted survival of ex vivo isolated thymocytes, including pro-T cells.
In vivo, however, transgenic Bcl-2 did not release T cell precursors from their phenotypic block and failed to increase progenitor or total thymocyte cellularity in c-kit or gamma(c) single or double mutants.
These data argue strongly against a role for Bcl-2 as a key mediator in signaling pathways linked to cytokine and growth factor receptors driving early thymocyte development.
Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) is essential for common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gamma(c))-dependent signaling: comparative analysis of gamma(c), Jak3, and gamma(c) and Jak3 double-deficient mice.
The common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gamma(c)) is an essential receptor component for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15, and thereby gamma(c)-deficient mice exhibit impaired T cell and B cell development.
The Janus family tyrosine kinase 3 (Jak3) is known to be associated with gamma(c), and the reported phenotypes of gamma(c)-deficient (gamma(c)(-)) and Jak3-deficient (Jak3(-)) mice are similar, indicating that Jak3 is an essential transducer of gamma(c)-dependent signals.
Nevertheless, certain differences have been suggested related to the range of actions of gamma(c) and Jak3.
To clarify whether gamma(c)-dependent cytokines can partially transduce their signals without Jak3, we compared lymphocyte development in gamma(c)(-), Jak3(-), and gamma(c) and Jak3 double-deficient (gamma(c)(-)Jak3(-)) mice in the same genetic background.
With the exception that T and B cells in Jak3(-) mice express high levels of gamma(c), the defects in thymocyte and peripheral T cell and B cell development are indistinguishable among gamma(c)(-), Jak3(-) and gamma(c)(-)Jak3(-) mice.
Interestingly, although Bcl-2 induction was previously suggested to be Jak3-independent, IL-7 cannot induce Bcl-2 expression in CD4 single-positive (SP) thymocytes in either gamma(c)(-) or Jak3(-) mice nor can IL-7 rescue CD4 SP thymocytes from dexamethasone-induced cell death in gamma(c)(-) or Jak3(-) mice.
These results indicate that Jak3 is absolutely essential for gamma(c)-dependent T cell and B cell development, and for gamma(c)-dependent prevention of thymocyte apoptosis.

In this paper we will present the evidence that the T(h)1/T(h)2 balance is regulated by the balance between RMp and OMp due to the disparate production of IL-12 versus IL-6 and IL-10.
The polarization of T(h)1/T(h)2 balance is dependent on the intracellular thiol redox status of macrophages due to the distinctive cytokine production.
The Th1/Th2 balance was examined both in resting cells and after polyclonal stimulation using two different methods:
As with the SSAT transgenic mice generated previously, the mice of the new line (MT-SSAT) suffered permanent hair loss, but this occurred considerably later than in the previous SSAT transgenic animals.
Liver was the most affected tissue in the MT-SSAT transgenic animals, revealed by putrescine overaccumulation, significant decrease in spermidine concentration and >90% reduction in the spermine pool.

Evidence has accumulated in support of a role of transient receptor potential (Trp) proteins as structural subunits of a class of Ca2+-permeable cation channels activated by agonists that stimulate IP3 formation-very likely through a direct interaction between the IP3 receptor and a Trp subunit of the Ca2+ entry channel.
Roles of Ca2+ and protein tyrosine kinase in insulin action on cell volume via Na+ and K+ channels and Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in fetal rat alveolar type II pneumocyte.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the roles of Ca2+ and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) in the insulin action on cell volume in fetal rat (20-day gestational age) type II pneumocytes.
On the other hand, the insulin action on cell volume in a Ca2+-free solution was completely blocked by quinine (1 mm, a blocker of Ca2+-activated K+ channel), but not by bumetanide and/or amiloride.

The promoter region of aldA contains two 10-bp sequences (5'-TGTTAATTAA-3') that perfectly match the proposed ArcA-P binding consensus (5'-[A/T]GTTAATTA[A/T]-3').
Alteration of the wild-type sequence from 5'-TGTTAATTAAC-3' to 5'-TCTTAATTAAG-3' or 5'-TATTAATTAAT-3' by site-directed mutagenesis markedly decreased the in vitro affinity of the promoter region for ArcA-P, and abolished the anaerobic repression of mutant att lambda::phi (aldA'-lacZ) transcriptional reporter constructs.

The two homologous presenilins are key factors for the generation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), since Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated mutations enhance the production of the pathologically relevant 42-amino acid Abeta (Abeta42), and a gene knockout of presenilin-1 (PS1) significantly inhibits total Abeta production.
We have found 1) that human CDP/cut acts as a repressor of CFTR transcription through the Y-box element by competing for the sites of transactivators hGCN5 and ATF-1; 2) that the ability of CDP/cut to repress activities of hGCN5 and ATF-1 activity is contingent on the amount of CDP/cut expression; 3) that histone acetylation may have a role in the regulation of gene transcription by altering the accessibility of the CFTR Y-box for sequence-specific transcription factors; 4) that trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase activity, activates transcription of CFTR through the Y-box element; 5) that the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity leads to an alteration of local chromatin structure requiring an intact Y-box sequence in CFTR; 6) that immunocomplexes of CDP/cut possess an associated histone deacetylase activity; 7) that the carboxyl region of CDP/cut, responsible for the transcriptional repressor function, interacts with the histone deacetylase, HDAC1.
Deletion and mutational analyses of the ANP promoter revealed that the Csx/Nkx-2.5-binding element (NKE2) located at -240 was required for high level transactivation by Csx/Nkx-2.5.
Although GATA-4 also potentiated the Csx/Nkx-2.5-induced transactivation of the artificial promoter that contains multimerized Csx/Nkx-2.5-binding sites, Csx/Nkx-2.5 reduced the GATA-4-induced transactivation of the GATA-4-dependent promoters.

The homeodomain protein IDX-1 increases after an early burst of proliferation during pancreatic regeneration.
Islet duodenal homeobox 1 (IDX-1/PF-1/STF-1/PDX-1), a homeodomain protein that transactivates the insulin promoter, has been shown by targeted gene ablation to be required for pancreatic development.
After 90% pancreatectomy (Px), the adult pancreas regenerates in a process recapitulating embryonic development, starting with a burst of proliferation in the epithelium of the common pancreatic duct.
In this model, IDX-1 mRNA was detected by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in total RNA from isolated common pancreatic ducts at levels 10% of those of isolated islets.
The IDX-1 mRNA levels were not significantly different for common pancreatic ducts of Px, sham Px, and unoperated rats and did not change with time after surgery.
By immunoblot analysis, IDX-1 protein was only faintly detected in these ducts 1 and 7 days after Px or sham Px but was easily detected at 2 and 3 days after Px.
Similarly, IDX-1 immunostaining was barely detectable in sham or unoperated ducts but was strong in ducts at 2-3 days after Px.
The increase of IDX-1 immunostaining followed that of BrdU incorporation (proliferation).
These results indicate a posttranscriptional regulation of the IDX-1 expression in ducts.
In addition, islets isolated 3-7 d after Px showed higher IDX-1 protein expression than control islets.
Thus, in pancreatic regeneration IDX-1 is upregulated in newly divided ductal cells as well as in islets.
The timing of enhanced expression of IDX-1 implies that IDX-1 is not important in the initiation of regeneration but may be involved in the differentiation of ductal cells to beta-cells.
A pancreatic islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase-related protein (IGRP) was cloned using a subtractive cDNA expression cloning procedure from mouse insulinoma tissue.
The longer, 1901-bp full-length cDNA encoded a 355-amino acid protein (molecular weight 40,684) structurally related (50% overall identity) to the liver glucose-6-phosphatase and exhibited similar predicted transmembrane topology, conservation of catalytically important residues, and the presence of an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal.

Assembly of the type 1 procollagen molecule: selectivity of the interactions between the alpha 1(I)- and alpha 2(I)-carboxyl propeptides.
Assembly of the heterotrimeric procollagen I molecule is initiated by interactions between the carboxyl propeptide domains of the completed nascent pro alpha chains.
The [pro alpha 1(I)]2[pro alpha 2(I)] heterotrimer is the predominant molecule, with much smaller amounts of stable [pro alpha 1(I)]3 homotrimer also being formed.
However, the [pro alpha 2(1)]3 homotrimer has not been detected, raising questions as to the mechanism of chain assembly and why [pro alpha2(1)]3 homotrimers are not formed.
These questions have been examined here by expressing the intact and amino- or carboxyl-terminal truncated C-propeptides of the pro alpha chains recombinantly in bacteria and in a coupled transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate system.
Their interactions were studied in vitro by binding analyses and in vivo by using the yeast two-hybrid system.
