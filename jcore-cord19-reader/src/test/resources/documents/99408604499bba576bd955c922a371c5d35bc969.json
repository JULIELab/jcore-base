Virions are enveloped, pleomorphic, 80 \u00c1/220 nm in diameter and they have club-shaped peplomers. According to the generally accepted model of coronavirus structure, viral genomic RNA is complexed with a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein, N protein, in a helical configuration. The surrounding envelope contains three viral proteins. The trimeric spike (S) protein, the major inducer of virus-neutralizing antibodies (Gebauer et al., 1991) , forms characteristic viral peplomers which are involved in virus attachment on the cell receptors and in virus cell fusion (de Hann et al., 2000) . The small membrane protein (E), recognized recently as a structural component of the coronavirus, has been found to be important for assembly of the viral envelope (Raamsman et al., 2000) . The membrane (M) glycoprotein is the most abundant structural protein; it spans the membrane bilayer three times, leaving a short NH 2 -terminal domain outside the virus and a long COOH terminus inside the virion (Rottier, 1995) . The M protein induces antibody-dependent complement-mediated virus neutralization (Woods et al., 1987) . Although its function is not completely clear, M seems to play a key role in virus assembly and budding.",

Transformants selected on 2 )/TY plates containing ampicillin (100 mg/ml) were screened by direct colony PCR, and by restriction digestion of purified plasmids. The sequence of inserts was verified. The sequence data obtained were compared with the sequence of the M gene of CCoV strain Insavc (accession number D13096).

Then isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mM to induce the expression of rMP, and the incubation was continued for further 8 h. Control cultures containing the empty pQE30 vector were processed in parallel. The rMP accumulated in the bacteria as inclusion bodies. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and used for the preparation of inclusion bodies (Fiermonte et al., 1993) . Cells from a liter of culture were resuspended in 20 ml of a buffer containing Hepes-NaOH 10 mM and 50 mM NaCl, pH 7, disrupted in a French press and centrifuged at 4 8C at 27 000)/g for 15 min.

Inclusion bodies, membrane fractions and samples taken from cultures at various point of growth were examined by PAGE in the presence of SDS on 17.5% gels (Laemmli, 1970) . The proteins either were stained with Coomassie Blue dye or were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF Immobilon P, pore size 0.45 mm) to determine the Nterminal sequence of the recombinant M protein.
