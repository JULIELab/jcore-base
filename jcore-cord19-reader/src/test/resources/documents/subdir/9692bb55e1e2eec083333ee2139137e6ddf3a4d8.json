Metagenomic approaches to pathogen detection, such as viral microarrays and deep sequencing, are promising tools to address emerging and non-diagnosable disease challenges. In this study, we used the Virochip microarray and deep sequencing to characterize the spectrum of viruses present in human sera from 123 Nicaraguan patients presenting with dengue-like symptoms but testing negative for dengue virus. We utilized a barcoding strategy to simultaneously deep sequence multiple serum specimens, generating on average over 1 million reads per sample. We then implemented a stepwise bioinformatic filtering pipeline to remove the majority of human and low-quality sequences to improve the speed and accuracy of subsequent unbiased database searches. By deep sequencing, we were able to detect virus sequence in 37% (45/123) of previously negative cases. These included 13 cases with Human Herpesvirus 6 sequences. Other samples contained sequences with similarity to sequences from viruses in the Herpesviridae, Flaviviridae, Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, Asfarviridae, and Parvoviridae families. In some cases, the putative viral sequences were virtually identical to known viruses, and in others they diverged, suggesting that they may derive from novel viruses. These results demonstrate the utility of unbiased metagenomic approaches in the detection of known and divergent viruses in the study of tropical febrile illness.",

The increased spread of dengue virus and its mosquito vectors in many subtropical regions over the past several decades, especially in Latin America and Asia [5] , highlights the need for additional methods of dengue virus surveillance. Diagnosing dengue relies on detecting viral nucleic acid or antigens in the blood or confirming the presence of anti-DENV IgM and IgG antibodies and therefore traditionally depends on RT-PCR, ELISA, and viral cell culture methods [5] [6] [7] . Dengue diagnostics are of crucial importance due to its broad spectrum of clinical presentations, global emergence and spread, unique disease epidemiology, and possible clinical relation to other as-yet unknown tropical febrile pathogens.",

Viral metagenomic approaches have also been employed as a diagnostic supplement to pathogen detection as part of public health monitoring systems [22] , but have been limited to shotgun sequencing of viral-enriched libraries and have yet to utilize deep sequencing data. Currently available sequencing platforms can generate millions to billions of sequencing reads per run, far exceeding large-scale shotgun sequencing [13] . Deep sequencing of clinical samples, in which hundreds of thousands to millions of sequencing reads are generated per sample, can be incorporated into stepwise virus detection pipelines [29] . Database searches using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and other alignment tools [30] can be used to identify sequences in samples that correspond to known and novel viruses, including those present at low concentrations or deriving from viruses that may be too divergent to be detected with PCR or microarray methods.

Virochip and deep sequencing were performed on positive control samples and on 123 dengue virus-negative serum samples. Using these methods, viruses were detected in 45 of 123 (37%) previously negative samples. Sequences derived from known and apparently divergent viruses. The viruses identified in some of the cases are known to induce symptoms consistent with those observed, though the definitive causative agent of these infections remains to be determined.",

            "text": "Dengue virus infection is a global health concern, affecting as many as 100 million people annually worldwide. A critical first step to proper treatment and control of any virus infection is a correct diagnosis. Traditional diagnostic tests for viruses depend on amplification of conserved portions of the viral genome, detection of the binding of antibodies to viral proteins, or replication of the virus in cell cultures. These methods have a major shortcoming: they are unable to detect divergent or novel viruses for which a priori sequence, serological, or cellular tropism information is not known. In our study, we use two approaches, microarrays and deep sequencing, to virus identification that are less susceptible to such shortcomings. We used these unbiased tools to search for viruses in blood collected from Nicaraguan children with clinical symptoms indicating dengue virus infection, but for whom current dengue virus detection assays yielded negative results. We were able to identify both known and divergent viruses in about one third of previously negative samples, demonstrating the utility of these approaches to detect viruses in cases of unknown dengue-like illness. denatured at 95uC for 2 min, cooled briefly on ice, then fluorescently labeled in reactions containing 100 mM sodium bicarbonate pH 9, 10% DMSO, and 667 mM Cy3 mono NHS ester (GE Healthcare) for 1 hour at 25uC. Labeled DNA was purified using DNA-CC-5 columns and added to hybridization reactions containing 36SSC, 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, and 0.25% SDS. Hybridization mixtures were heated at 95uC for 2 minutes, applied to microarrays, and hybridized overnight at 65uC. Following hybridization, arrays were washed twice in 0.576 SSC and 0.028% SDS and twice in 0.0576SSC, then scanned on an Axon GenePix 4000B microarray scanner. Three analysis tools were used to analyze Virochip data: E-predict [33] , Z-score analysis [34] , and cluster analysis [35] . An array was deemed positive for a particular virus if the virus was identified by at least two of these methods. Virochip results were deposited in the NCBI GEO database (GEO accession series: GSE28142).",

Library generation primers (Table S1) were modified from adapter A and adapter B sequences (Illumina). Samples were reverse transcribed and libraries were created and amplified as described above for the Virochip. Library molecules of approximately 300 bp were purified on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel, ethanol precipitated, and PCR amplified for 17 additional cycles using a 22-nt-long primer consisting of the 39-end of Illumina adapter A (primer 2) and the full-length 61-bp Illumina adapter B (primer 4) under the following conditions: 2 cycles of 94uC for 30 s, 40uC for 30 s, and 72uC for 1 min, followed by 15 cycles of 94uC for 30 s, 55uC for 30 s, and 72uC for 1 min. Amplicons generated with the correct adapter topology (one end with adapter A and the other with adapter B) were approximately 355 bp and were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from adapter A/A and adapter B/B amplicons, which migrate differently (approximately 40 bp smaller or larger than the expected size). An additional 10 cycles of PCR were then performed using the full-length adapter sequences as primers (primers 3 and 4). Libraries were validated by Sanger sequencing before high throughput sequencing. Following validation, samples were combined into five pools for sequencing. For pools one through four reverse transcription primers included a three or four-nucleotide barcode sequence at the 39-end. For pool five, barcodes were located internally in the adapter sequence. Each pool was sequenced on one lane of a flowcell on the Illumina Genome Analyzer II (pools 1-4) or HiSeq 2000 (pool 5). Pools' 1-4 molecules were sequenced as 67 nucleotide paired ends, and pool 5 molecules as 97 nucleotide paired ends. Paired-end sequencing was performed for several reasons: (1) to double the overall amount of data generated, (2) to double the amount of sequence information per molecule, and (3) to provide anchors from which additional sequence could be recovered by subsequent PCR.",

Paired reads for which at least one of the reads in the pair had at least 80% identity to the database were marked as human and removed from subsequent analyses. After removal of reads identified as human by BLAT, remaining reads were aligned and filtered by mapping to the human transcriptome using nucleotide BLAST (BLASTn version 2.2.21, word size 30, E value 10 23 ). Remaining reads were next aligned to the human genome using BLASTn (word size 30, E value 10 23 ), filtered, and again aligned to the human genome by BLASTn (word size 11, E value 10).

Despite the headway, metagenomic virus detection studies will have to confront several remaining difficulties concerning diagnostic accuracy. Foremost concerns include enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of deep sequencing-based diagnostic methods and re-evaluating the evidence for disease causality in light of increasingly sensitive nucleic acid detection and pathogen discovery methods. The former will require improved strategies to biochemically enrich and computationally identify viral sequences while reducing host background sequences. The latter will require a cautious reconsideration of criteria used to establish causal links between microbes and disease, as well as extensive case-by-case follow-up studies employing classical laboratory methods, such as serological analysis and cell culture amplification. It is important to highlight that observing viral sequence in sequencing data is insufficient to establish the role of a virus in disease causality. Like other detection strategies, deep sequencing will serve to inform secondary tests, including seroconversion assays, further nucleic acid testing, cell culture amplification, and additional investigations into plausible disease mechanisms.",

There were two instances where Virochip analysis identified a virus (TTV) that was not detected by deep sequencing (Table 1) . Deep sequencing, therefore, is a superior method for novel virus discovery, because it is more sensitive and provides more conclusive genotypic information than the Virochip. The NCBI TaxID and name of the virus species with the highest number of hits among those viruses with BLAST hits is given.",

The presence of sequences that lack even remote similarities to known species also highlights the need for further development of de novo assembly methods for metagenomic data.

Primary HHV-6 infection causes undifferentiated febrile illness and exanthem subitum (roseola infantum or sixth disease), an acute illness with high fever and rash that typically resolves in three to seven days [49] . Exanthem subitum is a common disease of infants worldwide, and HHV-6 infection most frequently occurs between 6 and 12 months of age [50] , with seropositivity estimates of .95% in adult populations in developed countries [51] .

A previous study detected integrated HHV-6 genomic sequence in ,1% of healthy blood samples [57] . Since detection of HHV-6 nucleic acid in serum alone does not prove active viral infection, we cannot definitively confirm that the HHV-6 sequences in these samples were not derived from the vertical transmission of chromosomally integrated virus.

We were unsuccessful in recovering a full genome sequence corresponding to any of the circovirus-like sequences, and it has not yet been possible to prove that these sequences were not an environmental artifact introduced during sample preparation. It is also possible that these sequences derive from other organisms, such as Giardia intestinalis or Entamoeba dispar, whose genomes encode proteins that share amino acid similarity with circovirus replicase proteins ( Figure 3) .

            "text": "Metagenomic approaches provide an effective high-throughput method to detect uncharacterized virus diversity in a tropical setting from many samples simultaneously. The findings presented in this study further our knowledge of well-characterized and previously unknown viruses present in serum collected from pediatric dengue-like illness patients and advance our understanding of the application of metagenomic approaches to human pathogen detection. Deep sequencing analysis of clinical samples holds tremendous promise as a diagnostic tool by permitting the detection of many different viruses simultaneously, including those present at low-copy numbers and of divergent origin. Major remaining barriers to high-throughput sequencing strategies becoming standard diagnostic practice include prohibitive cost, lengthy sample preparation time, and computationally intensive data analysis requirements. These challenges are magnified in resource-limited settings, such as Nicaragua, but are gradually being addressed. Industry hardware and technical advancements have steadily decreased the per-base cost of deep sequencing, and the results presented here strengthen our expectations of multiplexed sample preparation and bioinformatic data filtering within the framework of current secondgeneration sequencing platforms. Long-term bi-directional partnerships with developing country collaborators facilitate easier access to techniques not currently available on-site, such as deep sequencing, and are also important in providing training opportunities for local scientists and developing relevant pathogen tests and diagnostic policies. This study expands our understanding of the virus diversity in pediatric dengue-like illness in Nicaragua and the application of genomic detection techniques in a tropical setting, findings that are particularly valuable given the pressing need for improved global emerging pathogen surveillance. Figure S1 Virochip sensitivity using poliovirus control RNA. The Virochip can detect one poliovirus gRNA in a background of 10 5 HeLa RNA molecules. Poliovirus RNA was mixed with HeLa total RNA and analyzed on the Virochip. Eighty enterovirus Virochip oligos were found to be responsive to the poliovirus RNA and the mean fold above background of the normalized intensity of these oligos is plotted. Background is defined as the normalized intensity for each oligo in the HeLa-only control sample. The top E-predict hit in the 10 25 to 10 22 samples was human enterovirus C. (PDF) Figure 3 .
