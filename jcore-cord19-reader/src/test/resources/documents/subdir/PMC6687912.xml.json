            "text": "The presence of antibody (Ab), antibody-secreting cells (ASC), and multiple other B cell subsets in the CNS compartment are hallmarks of chronic inflammatory processes during persistent infection or demyelinating diseases. In the inflammatory demyelinating disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS), CNS-infiltrating B cells are associated with the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a diagnostic hallmark in 95% of patients resulting from intrathecal antibody (ItAb) production in the CNS compartment (1\u20133). The exact role of B cells and Ab in MS remains controversial, but nevertheless multiple B cell phenotypes are implicated in MS pathogenesis. IgG and complement deposition are frequently observed in active demyelinating lesions in MS (4\u20137), indicating local Ab and complement-mediated mechanisms may contribute to demyelination. The success of B cell depletion therapies (BCDT) targeting CD20+ B cells, including mature B cells to plasmablasts, have further implicated B cells in MS pathogenesis, as BCDT reduces the formation of new inflammatory lesions and relapses in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients and time to confirmed disease progression in young, inflammatory primary progressive MS (PPMS) patients with minimal effects on ItAb (8\u201312). Collectively, these findings implicate a critical, yet unclear role for multiple B cell phenotypes in MS pathogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying the recruitment and survival of diverse B cell populations in the CNS as well as factors responsible for fostering Ab production within the CNS compartment in MS and other chronic neuroinflammatory diseases are still largely undetermined.",

Classically, infiltration of immune cells into non-lymphoid tissue sites, including the CNS, was seen as a random and diffuse process. However, during chronic inflammation lymphoid neogenesis may occur in certain conditions whereby tissue-infiltrating immune cells form highly organized structures resembling SLOs. These structures, known as tertiary lymphoid organs or ectopic lymphoid follicles (ELF), are locally inducible within chronically inflamed sites and contain the organizational, cellular, and molecular features found in SLO essential for propagating immune cell activation and antigen-driven selection, ultimately sustaining tissue-specific immune responses (13\u201316). Furthermore, similar to SLO, ELF contain B cell-rich infiltrates and are implicated in promoting focal B cell organization to aid activation, affinity maturation, differentiation, class-switch recombination, and local Ab production (13, 16, 17). ELF can develop in nearly every organ in the body during infection, autoimmunity, and tumorigenesis, although the degree to which ELF recapitulate lymphoid tissue-like organization varies (13, 16, 18). These structures can provide a permissive environment for cellular and humoral immune responses independent of primary or secondary lymphoid tissue.",

            "text": "ELFs are particularly prominent during chronic inflammation, yet mouse models of neuroinflammation examining CNS compartmentalized immune responses, including ELF formation, have focused on acute rather than chronic disease. Studies in murine models of CNS demyelinating diseases including mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (19\u201323), Sindbis virus infection (24, 25), and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (18, 26\u201329) have highlighted the ability for the CNS to serve as a niche for persistent B cell accumulation. Critical B cell chemokines and trophic factors are constitutively expressed or upregulated during neuroinflammation, including trafficking chemokines, CXCL9/10 and CCL19/21, SLO-organizing chemokines CXCL13 and CXCL12, and survival factors and differentiation factors, including BAFF, APRIL, and IL-21 (19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 30\u201334). Both infiltrating immune cells and CNS-resident cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells, produce B cell-related chemoattractants and trophic factors in the CNS (19). However, the relative contribution of ELF in fostering CNS compartmentalized B cell responses during acute models of MS remains controversial. In adoptive transfer EAE models, ELFs have been noted within the meninges and express some characteristic lymphoid factors including IL-17, LT\u03b1, and chemokines involved in leukocyte homing to and within the lymph nodes such as CXCL13, CXCL9, and CCL19 (28, 35\u201338).",

            "text": "The pathology of progressive MS is complex and recapitulating all facets of progressive disease in an individual mouse model has proven to be challenging. Nonetheless, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) has been established as an accepted model of chronic MS, especially its progressive forms. Chronic TMEV infection of the CNS in susceptible strains of mice produces a progressive clinical disease course exemplified by accrued disability, including spastic paralysis. The model further parallels several hallmarks of progressive MS exhibiting both spinal cord and brain pathology, including demyelination, remyelination, atrophy, neuronal death, axonal injury, and persistent CNS inflammation (40\u201343). Furthermore, several studies document ItAb synthesis in the CNS during TMEV-IDD, similar to MS (44, 45). The phenotype of accumulating B cells and the role of ELF in supporting prolonged CNS compartmentalized inflammation and Ab production in TMEV-IDD has yet to be determined. Thus far, persistent accumulation of T cells and B cells (46) in the CNS during chronic TMEV-IDD and elevations in CSF Ab despite restored blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity (46, 47) suggest CNS compartmentalized cellular and humoral immune responses may be fostered during chronic TMEV-IDD.",

Spatial organization was examined by identifying the localization of T cells, key immune cells involved in initiating and organizing ELF formation and in promoting antigen-driven B cell activation, differentiation, and survival (16, 35, 67). Immunofluorescent staining of CD3+ T cells and IgG+ B cells demonstrated T cells aggregated with isotype-switched IgG+ B cells in the ventral lateral meninges and ventral midline, although there was no evidence for a discrete organization of T and B cell regions, a characteristic feature of SLO and SLO-like ELF (Figure 4A). To evaluate B cell differentiation within the CNS compartment, we simultaneously assessed B220 and IgG B cell localization and aggregation within perivascular and meningeal cellular infiltrates. Co-staining of B220 and IgG within spinal cord sections revealed frequent localization of B220+, IgG+, and occasional B220+ IgG+ double-positive cells within cell aggregations in the ventral lateral meninges and ventral midline vasculature with minimal evidence of organized clusters containing IgG and B220-expressing B cells (Figure 4A).",

To further evaluate whether immune cell aggregates expressed common features of SLO-like ELF, we utilized markers of proliferation and cell death, events indicative of ongoing antigen-driven selection within germinal center (GC) reactions in SLO and ELF (13, 16). Proliferation was assessed using Ki-67, and active caspase-3 was used as an indicator of apoptosis (Table 2). Immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67 and caspase-3 expression revealed sparse immunoreactivity within meningeal and perivascular cellular aggregates containing IgG+ cells (Figure 4B). Further evaluation of perivascular and meningeal aggregates also showed the absence of the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) marker CD21/35, indicating an absence of FDCs, a specialized stromal cell in SLO and ELF involved in trapping and presenting antigen in B cell follicles and in secretion of B cell supporting chemokines, adhesion molecules, and trophic factors (Table 2; Figure 4C) (14). To evaluate GC formation, structures essential for antigen-driven selection, somatic hypermutation, and isotype switching, we utilized GL7, a surface antigen present at high levels on GC B cells during GC reactions in SLO and ELF (Table 2) (52, 68). Immunostaining of TMEV-IDD spinal cords showed no evidence of GL7 immunopositivity within immune cell aggregates containing IgG+ B cells (Figure 4D). Thus, histological assessment revealed minimal evidence for SLO-like ELF formation.",

Flow cytometry showed minimal evidence for spinal cord-infiltrating B cells expressing a conventional GL7hi GC phenotype as depicted in the TMEV-IDD CLN (Figures 5A,B; red box), though modest GL7 expression was observed on a small proportion of spinal cord-infiltrating B cells (Figures 5B,C). Among GL7-expressing B cells in the spinal cord, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was comparable to GL7int \u201cactivated\u201d B cells (Table 1) in the CLN (Figures 5A,B) (23, 52, 68). GL7 expression analysis identified 10% or approximately 800 infiltrating B cells as expressing an \u201cactivated\u201d GL7int phenotype, with minimal detection of GL7hi or \u201cGC\u201d phenotype infiltrating cells (Figure 5D). In TMEV-IDD spinal cords, GL7int B cells were mostly IgD\u2212, confirming that the GL7 expression was elevated on activated/transitional B cells (data not shown). Observed GL7int expression among a proportion of B cells within the spinal cord implied these B cells had acquired an activated phenotype.",

Analysis of CD80 surface expression among CD45hi CD19+ B cells revealed expression on approximately 80% of infiltrating B cells (Figures 5E,F). Among CD80+ B cells, the majority were an IgD\u2212 phenotype, indicating CD80+ B cells include highly-activated, transitional, and/or Bmem phenotypes (Figure 5G). Extensive CD80 expression on CNS-infiltrating B cells suggested most B cells accumulating during chronic TMEV-IDD display an activated phenotype possibly driven by antigen and CD4 T cell-mediated help (54, 70, 71), or perhaps, by polyclonal activation (72).",

Therefore, we evaluated whether factors promoting B cell trafficking, differentiation, and survival were present in chronic TMEV-IDD. IL-21 is a cytokine produced predominately by CD4 T cells and is essential for promoting B cell survival and differentiation (73, 74). Additionally, IL-6, BAFF, and APRIL are cytokines which play crucial roles in B cell survival and differentiation and are primarily produced by astrocytes within the CNS during viral infection and autoimmunity (19, 75\u201377). Gene expression analysis of these factors revealed constitutive expression of IL-21, IL-6, BAFF, and APRIL within spinal cords (Figure 6A), consistent with previous studies highlighting basal expression within CNS tissue (21, 25).",

To assess if elevation in intrathecal production of B cell-related chemo-attractants and trophic factors was evident in the CSF of TMEV-IDD mice, we evaluated protein levels of B cell chemokines in the CSF and serum to establish a CSF/serum ratio. Results revealed moderately increased CXCL9 and CCL19 (p = 0.06) CSF/serum ratios, with significant increases in CSF/serum ratios among CXCL13 (p = 0.03) and CXCL12 (p = 0.005) in TMEV-IDD compared to sham-treated mice (Figure 7B). IL-6 and CXCL10 CSF/serum ratios revealed minimal alterations in chronic TMEV-IDD compared to sham-treated CSF samples. Elevated CSF/serum ratios in the absence of detectable increased BBB permeability [(47); manuscript submitted] suggest intrathecal production is responsible for the observed elevations in B cell trafficking chemokines in the CNS compartment.",

These cells likely underlie the observed elevations in CSF Ab production, including ItAb of IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3. Present results revealed that the majority of CD138+ ASC express MHCII, indicating a plasmablast phenotype. Our data, as well as previous studies in TMEV-IDD (47), have shown that few CD138+ ASCs display Ki-67 immunopositivity, suggesting their proliferative capacity is decreased (47). It is possible that our flow cytometry results are skewed toward detecting a plasmablast phenotype B cell due to downregulation of CD19 on terminally differentiated plasma cells (80). However, other viral-induced encephalitic models such as MHV and Sindbis have confirmed high percentages of CNS-infiltrating CD138+ MHCII \u201cplasmablast\u201d phenotype B cells in the inflamed CNS (24). Since most classical plasmablasts continue to proliferate and thus are Ki-67+, the isotype-switched B cells exhibiting a CD19hi, CD138+, MHCII+ Ki-67\u2212 phenotype in our experiments may represent a B cell phase intermediate between a plasmablast and terminally differentiated plasma cells, such as the early differentiated CD138hi MHCII+ plasma cell phenotype previously documented in kidney inflammation and observed following sheep red blood cell immunization (80, 81). MHCII-expressing ASCs have essential implications during neuroinflammation as MHCII+ ASC can not only sustain Ab production but can also engage in antigen presentation to potentiate local immune responses.",

CD80 is also upregulated on Bmem (55, 56, 83). During chronic TMEV-IDD a high proportion of spinal cord-infiltrating B cells expressed an isotype-switched, differentiated phenotype (~70%), yet only 20% of total CD19+ were CD138+ ASC. These data, in combination with the observed high number of CD80+ B cells, suggest CD138\u2212 isotype-switched B cells are Bmem in chronic TMEV-IDD. Future studies validating the presence of Bmem during chronic TMEV-IDD are required to assess conventional surface molecules present on murine Bmem, including co-expression of CD80 with PD-L2 and CD73 (84, 85). Investigating Bmem during chronic TMEV-IDD will be essential for our understanding of B cells in chronic demyelinating disease, including MS, as Bmem are antigen-experienced cells with potent antigen presentation capabilities, producing large amounts of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and have the potential to rapidly convert into antigen-specific ASC to sustain CNS-compartmentalized Ab synthesis (86, 87).",

In chronic and progressive MS, evidence for CNS compartmentalized B cell activity is supported by the relative absence of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the CNS caused by inflammatory cells derived from the periphery, and relatively reduced effectiveness for peripherally administered disease-modifying therapies, including anti-CD20, in eliminating CSF B cells (12, 93, 94). Furthermore, CNS compartmentalized inflammation including meningeal leukocyte aggregates, CSF B cells, and ItAb is associated with disease progression in MS (39). However, there is a significant gap in our understanding of the factors required for supporting B cell localization and functional activity within the CNS, including ELF formation, in MS and its animal models. During chronic TMEV-IDD as shown above, ItAb synthesis coincided with the accumulation of heterogeneous B cell subsets, including mature and isotype-switched B cells, frequently aggregating within meningeal and perivascular regions of the spinal cord, often localizing with T cells. Meningeal inflammatory aggregates lacked several conventional features of SLO-like ELF necessary for driving local B cell differentiation into antigen-specific Bmem or ASC. Spatial organization, heightened proliferation and cell death indicative of antigen-driven selection, FDC stromal networks, and detectable GL7 expression were all absent in chronic TMEV-IDD, a finding similar to previous studies in viral-induced demyelination models of MS and B cell-dependent EAE models (23, 29).",

In our studies, conventional B cell trafficking, organizing, and trophic factors were expressed in the CNS and may aid heterogeneous B cell phenotype accumulation and ItAb synthesis. These common features of meningeal aggregations during neuroinflammation occurred in the absence of SLO-like ELF formation and GC markers essential for fostering antigen-driven selection of immune cells and inducing somatic hypermutation, class switch recombination, and local differentiation. Specifically, discretely organized T and B cell follicles, supportive FDC stromal cells, Ki-67+ proliferating and caspase-3+ cells indicating ongoing antigen-driven selection, and germinal center GL7hi B cells were searched for, but not found, in our studies in the chronic phase of TMEV-IDD.",

Patients with RRMS and progressive forms of MS exhibit meningeal inflammatory aggregates (18, 36, 37, 39, 95\u201399), yet the presence of leukocyte aggregations does not confirm the meninges provide a niche for SLO-like ELF formation. Moreover, the pathology and molecules associated with meningeal inflammation have not been definitively determined. For instance, in MS there is no evidence thus far that the leukocyte aggregations in the CNS involve somatic hypermutation, including activation-induced deaminase (AID) expression, an enzyme essential for hypermutation of variable Ig genes and increased B cell receptor affinity for the antigen. In the viral-induced mouse model of demyelination, MHV, CNS inflammatory aggregates were observed yet AID transcript expression was absent among sorted B cells isolated from the CNS (21). Thus, leukocyte aggregations described in the CNS in MS may more closely resemble the \u201cimmature,\u201d non-SLO-like ELFs described in our experiments in TMEV-IDD, in contrast to ELFs outside of the CNS in chronic inflammatory diseases which are more SLO-like such as inducible forms of lymphoid tissue, i.e., iBALT (13, 16). This difference between CNS lymphoid aggregates and ELFs in inflammatory conditions outside of the CNS may be due to an inherent inability of the CNS to develop and organize SLO-like ELFs, even with chronic inflammation.",

            "text": "Our studies did not document SLO-like ELF in driving B cell persistence in the CNS compartment but revealed frequent immune cell aggregation within meningeal spaces. Moreover, upregulation of markers, including GL7 and CD80, on B cells in chronic TMEV-IDD suggests the majority are highly activated and may be antigen-experienced (52\u201354, 68, 69). It remains unclear whether B cells acquire an activated phenotype in the peripheral or CNS compartment or the exact mechanisms driving activation (polyclonal activators vs. CD4 T cell help). Frequent immune cell aggregation in both meningeal and perivascular spaces and CNS-infiltrating B cells displaying an activated/helped phenotype suggest CD4 T cell-dependent activation may occur in the CNS compartment. The meninges are known to be a niche for harboring cells essential for promoting ongoing T cell activation and effector responses, suggesting B cell activation may be supported by similar mechanisms (100, 101). The abundance of T cells in meningeal and perivascular aggregates in the CNS during chronic TMEV-IDD resembles immune aggregates described in other viral infections of the CNS as well as in SPMS patients (23, 29, 37). Although studies examining B and T cell contact-dependent interactions within the CNS remain limited, following MHV infection, B and T cell interactions were evident within meningeal spaces in the brain which may promote local B cell activation (23). It remains to be determined if CD4 T cells are necessary and/or sufficient for propagating B cell activation, sustained accumulation, and potential differentiation in the CNS in mouse models of MS and MS patients. An important factor derived from T cells which supports B cell survival and differentiation in SLO, IL-21, showed minimal elevations during chronic TMEV-IDD in contrast to reports of elevated IL-21 production in the CNS during the acute phase of viral-induced encephalitis (21, 25). Nonetheless, increased GL7 and CD80 expression suggests most infiltrating B cells during chronic TMEV-IDD exhibited a contact-dependent CD4 T cell \u201chelped\u201d phenotype. Further studies are needed to determine if T cell secreted factors or contact-dependent mechanisms are essential for sustaining B cell accumulation and activation within the CNS compartment.",

            "text": "Our results and previous studies (19\u201321, 25, 27, 28) highlight that diverse factors may foster persistent B cell accumulation and ItAb in the CNS compartment. These factors may range in complexity from the expression of adhesion molecules such as CEACAM1, which alone can promote meningeal aggregation, to ectopic expression of lymphoid chemokines, cytokines and trophic factors supporting aggregation, to well-defined ELF resembling SLO (16, 18, 35, 102). Our study demonstrates that fully developed ectopic germinal centers are not required to support diverse B cell phenotypes and chronic CNS ItAb production. Irrespective of the level of organization, meningeal aggregates have been extensively associated with underlying cortical demyelination, gray matter pathology, diffuse axonal and neuronal loss (95\u201399, 103, 104). Thus, it is imperative to further delineate factors supporting meningeal aggregations, as potential mechanisms for dissociating pathogenic inflammatory aggregations in MS and other neuroinflammatory diseases will likely depend on the level of organization and molecular/cellular factors sustaining these structures. A limitation of the current study characterizing CNS compartmentalized inflammation in a chronic model of MS is the absence of mechanistic studies linking inflammatory aggregates with disability and/or neurodegeneration. Nonetheless, our data provide an important platform for investigating the role of inflammatory aggregates in neurodegeneration and for probing targets to disturb aggregates. Previous studies documenting neuronal death, axonal damage, and demyelination within the ventral regions of the spinal cord (40, 46, 105\u2013107) in concert with our findings of frequent inflammatory aggregation in the ventral spinal cord, suggest a possible role of inflammatory aggregates in adjacent neurodegeneration.",
