Metagenomic approaches to pathogen detection, such as viral microarrays and deep sequencing, are promising tools to address emerging and non-diagnosable disease challenges. In this study, we used the Virochip microarray and deep sequencing to characterize the spectrum of viruses present in human sera from 123 Nicaraguan patients presenting with dengue-like symptoms but testing negative for dengue virus. We utilized a barcoding strategy to simultaneously deep sequence multiple serum specimens, generating on average over 1 million reads per sample. We then implemented a stepwise bioinformatic filtering pipeline to remove the majority of human and low-quality sequences to improve the speed and accuracy of subsequent unbiased database searches. By deep sequencing, we were able to detect virus sequence in 37% (45/123) of previously negative cases. These included 13 cases with Human Herpesvirus 6 sequences. Other samples contained sequences with similarity to sequences from viruses in the Herpesviridae, Flaviviridae, Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, Asfarviridae, and Parvoviridae families. In some cases, the putative viral sequences were virtually identical to known viruses, and in others they diverged, suggesting that they may derive from novel viruses. These results demonstrate the utility of unbiased metagenomic approaches in the detection of known and divergent viruses in the study of tropical febrile illness.",2012-02-07,"Yozwiak, Nathan L.; Skewes-Cox, Peter; Stenglein, Mark D.; Balmaseda, Angel; Harris, Eva; DeRisi, Joseph L.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,,True,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3274504/

The purified recombinant protein was then evaluated for its antigenicity and reliability in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of CCoV antibodies in dog sera. Fifty serum samples, screened previously by whole virus ELISA and Western blotting, were tested. When the performance of the new test was compared with those of whole virus ELISA and Western blotting, an excellent correlation was found with the latter two assays. The ELISA based on recombinant M protein represents an alternative and valid test for detection of antibodies to CCoV in dog sera.",2003-05-31,"Elia, Gabriella; Fiermonte, Giuseppe; Pratelli, Annamaria; Martella, Vito; Camero, Michele; Cirone, Francesco; Buonavoglia, Canio",Journal of Virological Methods,,,True,False,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0166-0934(03)00064-8
