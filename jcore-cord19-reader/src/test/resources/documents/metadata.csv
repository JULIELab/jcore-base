Metagenomic approaches to pathogen detection, such as viral microarrays and deep sequencing, are promising tools to address emerging and non-diagnosable disease challenges. In this study, we used the Virochip microarray and deep sequencing to characterize the spectrum of viruses present in human sera from 123 Nicaraguan patients presenting with dengue-like symptoms but testing negative for dengue virus. We utilized a barcoding strategy to simultaneously deep sequence multiple serum specimens, generating on average over 1 million reads per sample. We then implemented a stepwise bioinformatic filtering pipeline to remove the majority of human and low-quality sequences to improve the speed and accuracy of subsequent unbiased database searches. By deep sequencing, we were able to detect virus sequence in 37% (45/123) of previously negative cases. These included 13 cases with Human Herpesvirus 6 sequences. Other samples contained sequences with similarity to sequences from viruses in the Herpesviridae, Flaviviridae, Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, Asfarviridae, and Parvoviridae families. In some cases, the putative viral sequences were virtually identical to known viruses, and in others they diverged, suggesting that they may derive from novel viruses. These results demonstrate the utility of unbiased metagenomic approaches in the detection of known and divergent viruses in the study of tropical febrile illness.",2012-02-07,"Yozwiak, Nathan L.; Skewes-Cox, Peter; Stenglein, Mark D.; Balmaseda, Angel; Harris, Eva; DeRisi, Joseph L.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,,True,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3274504/

The purified recombinant protein was then evaluated for its antigenicity and reliability in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of CCoV antibodies in dog sera. Fifty serum samples, screened previously by whole virus ELISA and Western blotting, were tested. When the performance of the new test was compared with those of whole virus ELISA and Western blotting, an excellent correlation was found with the latter two assays. The ELISA based on recombinant M protein represents an alternative and valid test for detection of antibodies to CCoV in dog sera.",2003-05-31,"Elia, Gabriella; Fiermonte, Giuseppe; Pratelli, Annamaria; Martella, Vito; Camero, Michele; Cirone, Francesco; Buonavoglia, Canio",Journal of Virological Methods,,,True,False,custom_license,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0166-0934(03)00064-8

However, factors driving heterogeneous B cell subset accumulation and antibody (Ab) production in the CNS compartment, including the contribution of ectopic lymphoid follicles (ELF), during chronic CNS inflammation remain unclear and is a major gap in our understanding of neuroinflammation. We sought to address this gap using the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) model of progressive MS. In this model, injection of the virus into susceptible mouse strains results in a persistent infection associated with demyelination and progressive disability. During chronic infection, the predominant B cell phenotypes accumulating in the CNS were isotype-switched B cells, including Bmem and ASC with naïve/early activated and transitional B cells present at low frequencies. B cell accumulation in the CNS during chronic TMEV-IDD coincided with intrathecal Ab synthesis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Mature and isotype-switched B cells predominately localized to the meninges and perivascular space, with IgG isotype-switched B cells frequently accumulating in the parenchymal space. Both mature and isotype-switched B cells and T cells occupied meningeal and perivascular spaces, with minimal evidence for spatial organization typical of ELF mimicking secondary lymphoid organs (SLO). Moreover, immunohistological analysis of immune cell aggregates revealed a lack of SLO-like ELF features, such as cell proliferation, cell death, and germinal center B cell markers. Nonetheless, flow cytometric assessment of B cells within the CNS showed enhanced expression of activation markers, including moderate upregulation of GL7 and expression of the costimulatory molecule CD80. B cell-related chemokines and trophic factors, including APRIL, BAFF, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL19, and CXCL13, were elevated in the CNS. These results indicate that localization of heterogeneous B cell populations, including activated and isotype-switched B cell phenotypes, to the CNS and intrathecal Ab (ItAb) synthesis can occur independently of SLO-like follicles during chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease.",2019-08-02,"DiSano, Krista D.; Royce, Darlene B.; Gilli, Francesca; Pachner, Andrew R.",Front Immunol,,,True,True,comm_use_subset,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6687912/
