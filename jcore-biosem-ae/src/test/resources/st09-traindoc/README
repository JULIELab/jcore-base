The txt and .a1 files are the originals from the BioNLP Shared Task 2009 data.
The .a2 file in ../st09-predicted has been created by calling the BioSem event extractor
manually, using the "BioSemApplication" class in the respective project (i.e. the class
is not contained in this project!). The trained database used
to create this .a2 file is the one at src/test/resources/dbs-2009 in this
project, trained on the ST09 development data.
Thus, we expect the test to reproduce those very same results.
