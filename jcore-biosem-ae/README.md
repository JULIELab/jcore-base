# JCoRe BioSEM Analysis Engine
Wrapper for the [BioSEM Event Extraction System](https://github.com/JULIELab/jcore-dependencies/tree/master/biosem-event-extractor)

### Objective


### Requirement and Dependencies
 The input and output of an AE is done via annotation objects. The classes corresponding to these objects are part of the [JCoRe Type System](https://github.com/JULIELab/jcore-base/tree/master/jcore-types).
 Furthermore this AE is only a wrapper, so the [BioSEM Event Extraction System](https://github.com/JULIELab/jcore-dependencies/tree/master/biosem-event-extractor) is needed, too.
 Without a model this AE is not really of any use, therefore we encourage you to use one of the [JCoRe projects](https://github.com/JULIELab/jcore-projects) if you want to use this AE in your pipeline.

### Using the AE - Descriptor Configuration
 In UIMA, each component is configured by a descriptor in XML. Such a preconfigured descriptor is available under `src/main/resources/de/julielab/jcore/ ` but it can be further edited if so desired; see [UIMA SDK User's Guide](https://uima.apache.org/downloads/releaseDocs/2.1.0-incubating/docs/html/tools/tools.html#ugr.tools.cde) for further information.
